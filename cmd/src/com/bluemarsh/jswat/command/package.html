  <p>Contains the basic command infrastructure, including the default
  implementations of the CommandParser and several InputProcessors.</p>

  <h3>Writing New Commands</h3>

  <p>Writing commands for the debugger is actually very easy.</p>

  <p>The first step is to create the initial version of the class that
  will implement the <code>Command</code> interface. This is most
  easily done by extending the <code>AbstractCommand</code> abstract
  class and providing the implementation for the abstract methods. Note
  that you may name this class whatever is suitable for you, as the
  name of the command and the name of the implementing class are not at
  all related.</p>

  <p>Next, add the fully-qualified name of the class to a plain text
  file called <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.command.Command</code>, which
  should be located in <code>META-INF/services</code> in your module
  <code>.jar</code> file. See the NetBeans OpenAPIs documentation under
  &quot;Services &amp; Lookup&quot; for more information on services
  and how to define them.</p>

  <p>The final step is to add properties to the
  <code>Bundle.properties</code> file in the package containing your
  command class. These two properties must be named
  <code>&lt;name&gt;_Description</code> and
  <code>&lt;name&gt;_Help</code>, where &lt;name&gt; is the string
  returned from the <code>getName()</code> method of your command
  class.</p>

  <h3>Writing Input Processors</h3>

  <p>As with commands, writing input processors is quite easy.</p>

  <p>First, create the initial version of the class that will implement
  the <code>InputProcessor</code> interface.</p>

  <p>Next, add the fully-qualified name of the class to a plain text
  file called <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.command.InputProcessor</code>,
  which should be located in <code>META-INF/services</code> in your
  module <code>.jar</code> file. See the NetBeans OpenAPIs
  documentation under &quot;Services &amp; Lookup&quot; for more
  information on services and how to define them.</p>

  <p>Note that the ordering of the <code>InputProcessor</code>
  implementations listed in the above file is important. The order that
  the input processors are listed is the order in which they are
  executed by the command parser. NetBeans allows changing the order of
  service entries, which you can read about in the &quot;Services &amp;
  Lookup&quot; section of the OpenAPI documentation.</p>

  <h3>Writing a New Command Parser</h3>

  <p>While this is possible, it is quite unlikely that you will want to
  write your own command parser, as there is little value in doing so.
  Nonetheless, below is an explanation of how to go about doing
  this.</p>

  <p>Start by creating the initial version of the class that will
  implement the <code>CommandParser</code> interface. This is most
  easily done by extending the <code>AbstractCommandParser</code>
  abstract class and providing the implementation for the abstract
  methods.</p>

  <p>Next, add the fully-qualified name of the class to a plain text
  file called <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.command.CommandParser</code>,
  which should be located in <code>META-INF/services</code> in your
  module <code>.jar</code> file. See the NetBeans OpenAPIs
  documentation under &quot;Services &amp; Lookup&quot; for more
  information on services and how to define them.</p>

  <p>Note that in order to replace the implementation that is included
  in the debugger, you will need to &quot;remove&quot; it from the list
  of services. See the API documentation mentioned above for an example
  of how this is done.</p>
