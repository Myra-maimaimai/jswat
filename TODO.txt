- Issue 41: expanded nodes in tree/table views collapse on refresh
- Make sure the faded tree/table columns are visible in Linux/Solaris/Windows
- Classes view find action needs a keyboard shortcut
- Our tree-table view does not scroll and show nodes properly
- Fix all XXX/TODO issues in the code
- Issue 51: breakpoints sometimes fail to suspend debuggee
  - Look at how this might happen, that a resolved breakpoint doesn't suspend
  - Add unit tests to test for a breakpoint being hit multiple times
  - Use Cobertura to improve code coverage in unit tests
- Issue 52: update build instructions to mention updating installed IDE
  prior to building JSwat, since dependencies may require the absolute
  latest modules
- Document all the areas to test when upgrading to new NetBeans version
  - node double-click
  - node right-click actions
  - expanded node refresh
- Add to the release sanity test checklist
  - Install previous release version, run it, create something of everything
    (sessions, breakpoints, watches)
  - Install the new version and start it, watching the log for any issues
  - Make sure everything appears as before (sessions, breakpoints, watches)
- Update the splash and about image copyright years
- Task 42: make a release based on NetBeans 6.8
