$Id$

- Console mode
  - Commands that are needed right away
    - break <class id>:<line>
    - break <class id>.<method>[(argument types)]
    - clear <class id>:<line>
    - clear <class id>.<method>[(argument types)]
    - step [up]

    - suspend [thread id(s)]
    - where
  - Need a way to manage runtimes and set one as the default for a session
  - Show a few lines of source code each time a breakpoint is hit
  - Show a single line of source code for each single step
  - Need a way to read errors sent to ErrorManager
    - Remove all uses of ErrorManager in core/cmd/cli and replace
      with java.util.logging calls
  - Lacking a way to send input to the debuggee stdin stream
    - SendCommand is the starting point
    - OutputAdapter has the means, but nothing to read from
  - Commands that are needed before release
    - attach
    - catch
    - detach
    - ignore
    - classes
    - fields
    - locals
    - methods
    - up [n]
    - down [n]
    - thread
    - threads
    - threadgroups
    - threadlocks
    - monitor
    - unmonitor
    - watch
    - unwatch
    - session new|copy|delete
  - Test debugging
    - Reading from debuggee output streams
  - Read commands from an 'rc' file in the home directory
  - Commands to write later
    - redefine
    - interrupt
    - eval
    - send (sends input to debuggee)
    - Setting class load/unload breakpoints
    - Setting thread start/stop breakpoints
  - Define logging properties for the console mode so log messages are
    saved to the userdir

- Search for all TODO/XXX items and resolve or file bugs

- Make sure tools.jar is in the classpath of all of the projects
  - Mac has it in the classes.jar already
  - Test in another OS in VirtualBox

- Experiement with using low priority thread pool and Thread.yield() in
  OutputAdapter in ui module.
- Fix distributable/installer build

- Documentation updates
  - Explain how the modules build and how the suite is set up
    - Link to http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqWrapperModules
  - For each new external library added, need to add a class-path-extension
    to the nbcore/nbproject/project.xml so that it can be found
  - docs/dev/platform.html
    - Copy new org-openide-util.jar from NetBeans/platform
    - The org-openide-util.jar is not used when running in NetBeans
  - Write a tutorial on using the console interface
    - Command line arguments are interpreted as command input
    - A unique prefix for a command will invoke that command (e.g. hi => history)
    - RC-like file for commands that are executed at startup
      - Look for .jswatrc and jswat.ini in user.home and user.dir
