    - threadlocks
    - monitor
    - unmonitor

  - Test debugging
    - Reading from debuggee output streams
  - Read commands from an 'rc' file in the home directory
  - Commands to write later
    - redefine
    - interrupt
    - eval
    - send (sends input to debuggee)
    - Setting class load/unload breakpoints
    - Setting thread start/stop breakpoints

- Search for all TODO/XXX items and resolve or file bugs

- Make sure tools.jar is in the classpath of all of the projects
  - Mac has it in the classes.jar already
  - Test in another OS in VirtualBox

- Fix distributable/installer build

- Documentation updates
  - Explain how the modules build and how the suite is set up
    - Link to http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqWrapperModules
  - For each new external library added, need to add a class-path-extension
    to the nbcore/nbproject/project.xml so that it can be found
  - docs/dev/platform.html
    - Copy new org-openide-util.jar from NetBeans/platform
    - The org-openide-util.jar is not used when running in NetBeans
  - Write a tutorial on using the console interface
    - Command line arguments are interpreted as command input
    - A unique prefix for a command will invoke that command (e.g. hi => history)
    - RC-like file for commands that are executed at startup
      - Look for .jswatrc and jswat.ini in user.home and user.dir
