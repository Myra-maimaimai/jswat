JSWAT TASK LIST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$Id$

- Test the core and cmd unit tests on Windows XP
- Fix the branding that seems to work but the build file says otherwise
- Fix distributable/installer build

- Documentation updates
  - Explain how the modules build and how the suite is set up
    - Link to http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqWrapperModules
  - For each new external library added, need to add a class-path-extension
    to the nbcore/nbproject/project.xml so that it can be found
  - docs/dev/platform.html
    - Copy new org-openide-util.jar from NetBeans/platform
    - The org-openide-util.jar is not used when running in NetBeans
  - Write a tutorial on using the console interface
    - Prompt may become separated from cursor due to asynchronous output
    - Command line arguments are interpreted as command input
    - A unique prefix for a command will invoke that command (e.g. hi => history)
    - RC-like file for commands that are executed at startup
      - Looks for .jswatrc and jswat.ini in user.home and user.dir
    - Using runtime command to set Java runtimes for session
