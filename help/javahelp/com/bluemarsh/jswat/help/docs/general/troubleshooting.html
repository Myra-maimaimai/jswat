  <h3>Red underlines in source viewer</h3>

  <p>The red squiggly underlines in the source viewer are an indication
  that the Java parser in NetBeans was unable to resolve certain
  symbols. This is quite normal as you may not have configured the
  sourcepath or classpath to include everything required in your Java
  application. The error indiciators are harmless and do not impact the
  performance of JSwat. You can safely ignore them.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoints fail to resolve</h3>

  <p>Breakpoints that refuse to resolve can be caused by a few
  conditions.</p>

  <p>First, if you are setting a line breakpoint in a source file, make
  sure that the source file you are setting the breakpoint in actually
  pertains to the code you are debugging. This can arise when you have
  multiple branches of code with similar source files.</p>

  <p>Next, are you certain there is executable code at the line on which
  you have set the breakpoint? If a Java statement is split across more
  than one line, not all of those lines are considered to be
  "executable", and thus a breakpoint may never resolve if set on one of
  those lines.</p>

  <p>To be sure which source lines have executable code, use the
  <code>lines</code> command in the <strong>Commands</strong> window.
  This command takes a class name argument and displays the line numbers
  containing executable code.</p>
