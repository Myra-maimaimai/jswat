  <p>The following page describes what to do when you run into a
  problem that is preventing you from getting work done. Please take a
  moment and read through this page before sending an email asking for
  help.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Read the User&#39;s Guide in the JSwat installation directory,
    which explains most of the primary debugger functionality.</li>

    <li>Read the help pages on the pertinent topics. The commands also
    have a help feature, just invoke the <code>help</code>
    command.</li>

    <li>Review the FAQ on the web site (www.bluemarsh.com) to see if
    this problem has come up before.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are two avenues for asking questions about JSwat. The first
  is to email the author (nfiedler@bluemarsh.com) and the second is to
  send the question to the jswat-user mailing list. When asking for
  help, be sure to mention the <strong>operating system</strong>,
  <strong>JDK version</strong>, and the <strong>JSwat version</strong>
  that you are using.</p>
