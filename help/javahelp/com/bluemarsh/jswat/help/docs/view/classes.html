  <h2>Viewing Loaded Classes</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Classes</strong> view shows the class loaders and all
  of the classes that each class loader has loaded into the debuggee.
  The list of classes are shown in sorted order by name within their
  respective packages. The packages are shown in tree form to ease
  navigation within the list of classes.</p>

  <p>The view updates its contents when ever the session is suspended,
  whether by hitting a breakpoint, or if the Pause action is invoked. To
  cause the view to refresh while the debuggee is running, simply invoke
  the <strong>Refresh</strong> item in the view context menu.</p>

  <h3>Fix and Continue (hotswap)</h3>

  <p>This view offers a <strong>hotswap</strong> function to replace the
  bytecode of a class without having to restart the debuggee. This
  attempts to locate the <code>.class</code> file for the corresponding
  class in the classpath of the debuggee. This means the Java code that
  you want to fix should be compiled prior to invoking this operation.
  This requires that the class is available to the debugger on the file
  system, as it cannot be retrieved over the network.</p>

  <p>Breakpoints in a redefined class will be invalidated for the
  remainder of the active session. As a work-around, disable and
  re-enable the breakpoints.</p>

  <h4>From the JDI documentation</h4>

  <p>This function does not cause any initialization except that which
  would occur under the customary JVM semantics. In other words,
  redefining a class does not cause its initializers to be run. The
  values of preexisting static variables will remain as they were prior
  to the call. However, completely uninitialized (new) static variables
  will be assigned their default value.</p>

  <p>If a redefined class has instances then all those instances will
  have the fields defined by the redefined class at the completion of
  the call. Preexisting fields will retain their previous values. Any
  new fields will have their default values; no instance initializers or
  constructors are run.</p>

  <p>If a method that gets modified by a redefineClasses operation has
  current activations, those activations will continue to execute the
  old version of the method. New calls will get the new version of the
  method. In this case, all information about the old version of the
  method (eg, its local variables, line numbers, ...) is lost and cannot
  be recovered by the JDI client. All operations that return information
  about the method will return information about the new version of the
  method. Breakpoints that are set in the method will be set in the new
  version, not the old version.</p>

  <p>Some JVMs do not offer unrestricted class redefinition.
  Restricted class redefinition disallows the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changing the schema (the fields)</li>
    <li>Changing the hierarchy (subclasses, interfaces)</li>
    <li>Deleting a method</li>
    <li>Changing class modifiers</li>
    <li>Changing method modifiers</li>
  </ul>
