  <h2>Viewing the Sessions</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Sessions</strong> view shows the open sessions. Each
  session represents a collection of settings and breakpoints, and holds
  the connection to the debuggee. Multiple sessions can be opened
  simultaneously, each connected to a different debuggee. The
  breakpoints set in each session are distinct, and may even refer to
  the same location in your source code.</p>

  <p>The current session is indicated by the icon having a bold outline.
  You can make a session the current one by double-clicking on it in the
  view.</p>

  <p>The view context menu allows you to manage the sessions, such as
  creating new ones, copying existing sessions, and removing them when
  they are no longer needed.</p>

  <p>The toolbar contains a component for displaying the status of the
  current session, as well as allowing you to easily change to another
  session (making that session the current one). The icon next to the
  session name in this component indicates whether the session is
  connected to a debuggee, or if the debuggee is suspended or not.</p>
