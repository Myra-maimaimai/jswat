  <h2>Viewing the Breakpoints</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Breakpoints</strong> view shows the breakpoints, which
  generally represent locations in the debuggee at which execution will
  stop. Other types of breakpoints are triggered by certain events,
  such as a class being loaded or a thread starting.</p>

  <p>The view context menu allows you to manage the breakpoints, such
  as creating new ones, and removing them when they are no longer
  needed.</p>
