  <h2>Threads and Groups</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Threads</strong> view shows the threads and their
  parent thread groups.</p>

  <p>The <strong>current</strong> thread is indicated by an icon with a
  bold outline. Setting the current thread controls which frames are
  shown in the <strong>Call Stack</strong> view. This is done by
  double-clicking on the thread node, or by selecting <em>Set
  Current</em> from the context menu.</p>

  <p>The view updates its contents when ever the session is suspended,
  whether by hitting a breakpoint, or if the Pause action is invoked. To
  cause the view to refresh while the debuggee is running, simply invoke
  the <strong>Refresh</strong> item in the view context menu.</p>

  <p>The view context menu has other actions available.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Interrupt</strong></dt>
    <dd>This sends an interrupt signal to the selected thread.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Resume</strong></dt>
    <dd>This decrements the suspend count of the selected thread.
    When the suspend count reaches zero, the thread will resume.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Suspend</strong></dt>
    <dd>This increments the suspend count of the selected thread.
    Any non-zero value will cause the thread to suspend.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <strong>Threads</strong> view, like other tree-structured
  views, will attempt to keep the expanded branches open while stepping
  through code. If, however, you have clicked on a column header in the
  view in order to sort the display, the tree will always collapse when
  it is updated. This is apparently a feature the tree-table component
  in the NetBeans Platform.</p>
