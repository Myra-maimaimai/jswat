  <h2>Threads and Groups</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Threads</strong> view shows the threads and their
  parent thread groups.</p>

  <p>The <strong>current</strong> thread is indicated by an icon with a
  bold outline. Setting the current thread controls which frames are
  shown in the <strong>Call Stack</strong> view. This is done by
  double-clicking on the thread node, or by selecting <em>Set
  Current</em> from the context menu.</p>

  <p>The view updates its contents when ever the session is suspended,
  whether by hitting a breakpoint, or if the Pause action is invoked. To
  cause the view to refresh while the debuggee is running, simply invoke
  the <strong>Refresh</strong> item in the view context menu.</p>

  <h3>Trace Methods</h3>

  <p>By selecting a thread and invoking the <strong>Trace
  Methods</strong> item in the node context menu, a trace breakpoint
  will be created. It will be filtered by the name of the thread and
  indicate every time when any method is entered or exited while
  executing in the named thread. The output will be in the debugger
  console (in the <strong>Output</strong> window).</p>

  <p>The view context menu has other actions available.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Interrupt</strong></dt>
    <dd>This sends an interrupt signal to the selected thread.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Resume</strong></dt>
    <dd>This decrements the suspend count of the selected thread.
    When the suspend count reaches zero, the thread will resume.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Suspend</strong></dt>
    <dd>This increments the suspend count of the selected thread.
    Any non-zero value will cause the thread to suspend.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <strong>Threads</strong> view, like other tree-structured
  views, will attempt to keep the expanded branches open while stepping
  through code. If, however, you have clicked on a column header in the
  view in order to sort the display, the tree will always collapse when
  it is updated. This is apparently a feature the tree-table component
  in the NetBeans Platform.</p>
