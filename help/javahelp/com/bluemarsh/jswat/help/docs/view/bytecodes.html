  <h2>Viewing Method Byte Codes</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Bytecodes</strong> view shows the interpreted byte
  codes of the current method. Because the byte code interpreter must
  have access to other class information, in addition to the method, it
  is necessary for the <code>.class</code> file to be read directly in
  order to gather all necessary information. For this reason, the
  <code>.class</code> file must be accessible to the debugger and must
  be on the classpath in order for it to be found.</p>

  <p>While reading the codes from the <code>.class</code> file means the
  byte codes are not read from the debuggee, JSwat does ensure that the
  byte codes read from the class are the same as the byte codes for the
  corresponding method in the debuggee. If those codes differ, the byte
  codes view will display a warning icon.</p>
