  <h2>Local Varibles and Fields</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Variables</strong> view shows local variables within
  the current debugging context (combination of current thread and stack
  frame). The fields of the current class ("this") are shown under a
  node called <strong>this</strong> in the display. This allows you to
  view any local variables that may have the same name as a field in the
  current class.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Variables</strong> view, like other tree-structured
  views, will attempt to keep the expanded branches open while stepping
  through code. If, however, you have clicked on a column header in the
  view in order to sort the display, the tree will always collapse when
  it is updated. This is apparently a feature of the tree-table
  component in the NetBeans Platform.</p>

  <h3>Setting Watch Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>The view context menu provides an item that creates a special type
  of variable breakpoint. This breakpoint is set for a particular field
  in a specific instance of the enclosing class. When that field is
  changed the breakpoint will suspend the debuggee. You can change the
  attributes of the breakpoint via the <a
  href="breakpoints.html">Breakpoints</a> view. Because this breakpoint
  is set to filter on a specific object instance, it will self-destruct
  when the session disconnects from the debuggee, as there is no way for
  it to connect with that object later.</p>
