  <h2>Call Stack</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Call Stack</strong> view shows the stack frames of the
  current thread, in order from most recent entry to the oldest entry
  (usually <code>Thread.run()</code> or the <code>main</code>
  method).</p>

  <p>The <strong>current</strong> stack frame is indicated by an icon
  with a bold outline. Setting the current stack frame controls which
  frame the <strong>Variables</strong> view will show. This is done by
  double-clicking on the frame entry, or by selecting <em>Set
  Current</em> from the context menu.</p>

  <p>The <em>Set Breakpoint</em> context menu item will create a
  breakpoint at the exact location of the stack frame. Because this type
  of breakpoint does not make use of the source file name and line
  number information (which may not be available depending on how the
  class containing that location was compiled), it can only be used
  during the active debugging session. Once the debugger is disconnected
  from the debuggee, the breakpoint will self-destruct.</p>

  <p>The <em>Show Source</em> context menu item will display the source
  code for the selected call stack entry. This requires that the
  sourcepath be set to include the corresponding source file.</p>

  <h3>Popping Frames</h3>

  <p>When the debuggee is suspended due to a debugging event, it is
  possible to use the <strong>Pop Frames</strong> action to pop frames
  from the top of the call stack. All frames up to and including the
  selected frame will be popped of the stack. There are a number of
  conditions which apply when frames are popped, as listed below.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>After frames are popped, the thread will be suspended at the
    invoke instruction of the method that created the popped
    frame.</li>

    <li>Changes made within that method to its arguments will remain
    intact.</li>

    <li>Locks acquired by a popped frame are released when it is
    popped.</li>

    <li>Finally blocks are not executed.</li>

    <li>The values of fields are unchanged, as are external resources
    such as I/O streams.</li>

    <li>The debuggee might be placed in a state that is impossible to
    reproduce with normal program flow; for example, order of lock
    acquisition might be perturbed. Thus the debuggee may proceed
    differently than the developer would expect.</li>
  </ul>
