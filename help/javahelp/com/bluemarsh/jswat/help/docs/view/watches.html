  <h2>Watched Expressions</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The <strong>Watches</strong> view shows the values of expressions
  as evaluated within the current debugging context (combination of
  current thread and stack frame). You can add new expressions to the
  view by right-clicking and selecting <em>Add Watch</em> from the
  context menu. Simply enter any Java expression (with some
  restrictions, see the evaluator link below) and it will be evaluated
  each time the debuggee is suspended (when a breakpoint is hit, and
  while single-stepping).</p>

  <p>Removing watched expressions is as easy as creating them, just
  right-click on the watch node and select "Delete" from the context
  menu.</p>

  <h3>Fixed Watches</h3>

  <p>The <em>Add Watch</em> dialog has a checkbox to create a fixed
  watch. A fixed watch is very different from a normal watch. While a
  normal watch expression is evaluated each time the debuggee suspends,
  the fixed watch expression is evaluated just one time, and it must
  refer to an object. This object is then stored as a reference such
  that the same object is shown every time the debuggee suspends. This
  can be quite useful if you are only interested in how a single object
  changes during the lifetime of your application.</p>

  <p>Fixed watches will self-destruct when the debugger disconnects from
  the debuggee. This is necessary because the object references are only
  valid during a single debugging session.</p>

  <h3>Display Modifiers</h3>

  <p>When creating a new watch, you can append the value with one of
  several flags, which controls how the value is displayed. Currently
  this is only effective for primitive values (e.g. byte, integer,
  char). For example, if the expression <code>nvalue</code> referred to
  an <code>int</code> value, you could enter the expression as
  <code>nvalue,x</code> to see the value in hexadecimal format. Below is
  a table of the supported modifiers.</p>

  <table summary="display modifiers" border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Modifier</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>,b</td>
      <td>Binary</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>,o</td>
      <td>Octal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>,s</td>
      <td>String</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>,u</td>
      <td>Unicode</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>,x</td>
      <td>Hexadecimal</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>For primitive types where the given modifier does not make sense,
  the evaluated value will be returned unmodified (e.g. if you were to
  use <code>x</code> on a <code>boolean</code>).</p>

  <h3>Sorting</h3>

  <p>The <strong>Watches</strong> view, like other tree-structured
  views, will attempt to keep the expanded branches open while stepping
  through code. If, however, you have clicked on a column header in the
  view in order to sort the display, the tree will always collapse when
  it is updated. This is apparently a feature the tree-table component
  in the NetBeans Platform.</p>
