  <h2>Remote Debugging</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Remote debugging is the process of debugging a program that is
  running on a different computer. This technique is useful when you are
  developing a program that runs on a server or in a different
  environment than the computer on which you are developing the program.
  This method can be used even for programs running on the same machine
  as the debugger, which is useful if that program has a complex startup
  procedure.</p>

  <p>Attaching to a remote debuggee is performed by way of the attach
  dialog. This dialog prompts you for a few pieces of information, some
  of which will have default values if the fields are left blank.</p>

  <p>You can open the dialog box by choosing Session &gt; Attach.</p>

  <h3>To start remote debugging:</h3>

  <h4>Attaching</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>On the computer where program is located, start the program in
    debugging mode. See your VM documentation for instructions on
    starting a program in debugging mode. For the Sun Microsystems Java
    Virtual Machine, the options can be found at:<br><a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/doc/conninv.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/doc/conninv.html</a></li>

    <li>In the Attach dialog, select the connector type and enter any
    required information, then click Attach. See your VM documentation
    for information about the connectors it provides.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Listening</h4>

  <p>Listening for a connection from a debuggee differs in that the
  debugger starts listening for a connection from the debuggee, which
  must occur before the debuggee has been launched.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Attach dialog, select the connector type and enter any
    required information, then click Attach. See your VM documentation
    for information about the connectors it provides.</li>

    <li>On the computer where program is located, start the program in
    debugging mode. See your VM documentation for instructions on
    starting a program in debugging mode. For the Sun Microsystems Java
    Virtual Machine, the options can be found at:<br><a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/doc/conninv.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/doc/conninv.html</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>Note that if the debuggee is not launched within the timeout
  period defined in the <strong>Options</strong> dialog, the debugger
  will cease listening for a connection.</em> A progress bar is
  displayed to indicate that the debugger is waiting. The listen
  operation can be cancelled by clicking on the progress bar and
  clicking the close button.</p>

  <h4>Options</h4>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Resume immediately</em></dt>

    <dd>If checked, the debugger will instruct the debuggee to resume
    execution as soon as a connection is established.</dd>

    <dt><em>Ignore debuggee classpath</em></dt>

    <dd>If checked, the debugger will use the value for
    &quot;Classes&quot; in the session settings, rather than the
    classpath defined by the JVM running the debuggee application.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>What to do next</h3>

  <p>After attaching to the debuggee, you are ready to begin debugging
  by setting breakpoints and stepping through your code.</p>

  <p><em>Note that the classpath session setting will temporarily take
  on the value of the classpath setting in the debuggee.</em> To learn
  more about the classpath and how it is used, see the <a href=
  "../session/paths.html">Classpath and Sourcepath</a> topic.</p>
