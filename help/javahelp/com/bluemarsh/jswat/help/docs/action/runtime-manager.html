  <h2>Managing Debuggee Runtimes</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The runtime manager dialog displays a list of the currently
  defined Java runtimes available for launching a debuggee. Each
  runtime specifies the path to the base directory of the Java runtime,
  the name of the executable that starts the runtime, and optional Java
  class source paths.</p>

  <p>You can open the dialog box by choosing Tools &gt; Runtime
  Manager.</p>

  <h3>Adding a Runtime</h3>

  <p>To add a new runtime for use in launching a debuggee, click on the
  &quot;Add Runtime&quot; button in the Runtime Manager dialog. A file
  chooser will appear -- use this to select the base directory of an
  installed Java runtime. The Runtime Manager dialog will then
  automatically attempt to determine the name of the runtime
  executable, as well as possible locations of the source code for the
  Java core classes.</p>

  <h3>Removing a Runtime</h3>

  <p>In the list of available runtimes, select the runtime to be
  deleted. Then click the Remove button and the selected runtime will
  be removed from the list. Note the installed runtime itself is left
  untouched.</p>

  <h3>Specifying Runtime Details</h3>

  <h4>Executable Filename</h4>

  <p>The name of the runtime executable will very likely be
  <code>java</code> or <code>java.exe</code>, depending on whether your
  system is Unix-like or Microsoft Windows. The Runtime Manager will
  have already attempted to locate a suitable executable, but if your
  runtime is different than the standard, you may specify a different
  executable name here. Note that on Windows you will need to include
  the <code>.exe</code> extension on the name of the executable. You
  may include a path to the executable, if necessary, although the path
  must be relative to the runtime base directory.</p>

  <h4>Source Paths</h4>

  <p>In most cases, the standard <code>src.zip</code> will contain the
  source code for the Java core classes (e.g.
  <code>java/lang/String.java</code>). Other possible choices are
  <code>src.jar</code> and a directory named <code>src</code>. The
  Runtime Manager will have already attempted to locate all possible
  source locations, but if your runtime is different than the standard,
  you may specify different paths using the source path editor portion
  of the Runtime Manager dialog.</p>

  <p>Note that the source paths provided for the runtime will be added
  to the source path of the current session. If you do not want this to
  happen, then remove all of the source paths for the runtime using the
  Runtime Manager dialog.</p>
