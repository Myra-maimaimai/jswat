  <h2>Starting a Local Debuggee</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Launching a new debuggee is performed by way of the launch dialog.
  This dialog prompts you for several pieces of information, most of
  which will have default values if the fields are left blank.</p>

  <p>You can open the dialog box by choosing Session &gt; Start.</p>

  <h3>Paramaters</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Java Runtime</em></dt>

    <dd>Use the combo box to choose the runtime to launch the debuggee.
    If the list is empty, click on the &quot;...&quot; button next to
    the list to define a runtime. In most cases a default runtime will
    be automatically discovered and added to the list.</dd>

    <dt><em>JVM Arguments</em></dt>

    <dd>These are options to the debuggee JVM, such as
    <code>-X..</code>, <code>-hotspot</code>, <code>-ea</code>,
    <code>-jar ..</code>, and <code>-D..</code>. When using the
    <code>-jar</code> option, you should put the name of the jar file
    in the Class Name field.</dd>

    <dt><em>Class Name</em></dt>

    <dd>This is the name of the class to be debugged, and this class
    must define a <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
    method in order for the debuggee JVM to start correctly. This is
    typically the bootstrap class in your application. This field can
    have the name of a JAR file instead of a class, in which case the
    JAR file must have the <strong>Main-Class</strong> property set in
    the manifest.</dd>

    <dt><em>Class Arguments</em></dt>

    <dd>These are the arguments to be passed to your main class. These
    are the same as the arguments that come after your main class name
    when launching your program from the command line.</dd>

    <dt><em>Resume immediately</em></dt>

    <dd>Checking this option causes the debuggee to start execution as
    soon as the JVM has completed its startup process. Unchecked, the
    debuggee will wait for you to instruct it to resume.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Classpath</h3>

  <p>Use the path editor to define the classpath for your application.
  Add each of the .jar, .zip, and directories that your application
  needs via the Add button. <em>You can add arbitrary values by simply
  typing them into the file selector dialog&#39;s input field.</em></p>

  <h3>What to do next</h3>

  <p>After pressing the Launch button in the launch dialog, the new
  debuggee process will start in a few seconds. The debuggee JVM then
  invokes the <code>main</code> method of the class named in the
  &quot;Class Name&quot; field. At this point you are ready to begin
  debugging by setting breakpoints and stepping through your code.</p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>Class not found</h4>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Is the classpath set correctly?</strong></dt>

    <dd>On Microsoft Windows you need to include the drive
    specification (e.g. <code>C:</code>) and use backslash (\) as the
    file separator.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Did you enter a proper class name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>Note that a class name is of the form
    <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and is <em>not</em> the name of the
    source file or the bytecode file (<code>.class</code>).</dd>

    <dt><strong>Is the name of the class fully-qualified?</strong></dt>

    <dd>If your class is defined in a package, you need to include that
    as part of the class name (e.g. <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Be
    sure <em>not</em> to include the <code>.class</code> extension of
    the class file. The class name refers to the name of the class, not
    the name of the file in which it is stored.</dd> </dl>
