  <h2>Creating Breakpoints</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Creating breakpoints is done using the New Breakpoint dialog box.
  You can open the dialog box by choosing Breakpoint &gt; New
  Breakpoint from the menu bar.</p>

  <p>There are several types of breakpoints that can be created, which
  are described below.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Class</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a class matching a given pattern loads or unloads.
    Since a class may be loaded by multiple class loaders, this may be
    hit more than once.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Exception</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when an exception matching a given pattern is thrown and
    caught or not caught. In Java 5.0, uncaught exceptions are
    difficult to detect and thus this type of breakpoint may not always
    stop when expected.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Line</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a particular line of code in a source file is
    reached. This can only be created by clicking on a line in the
    source viewer.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Method</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a particular method in a class matching a given
    pattern is reached.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Thread</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a thread matching a given pattern is started or
    dies.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Trace</strong></dt>

    <dd>Never stops, only shows a brief message in the Output window
    when any method is entered and exited. Produces copious amounts of
    output.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Variable</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a specific field in a class is accessed or
    modified.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Breakpoints support optional actions that are performed when the
  breakpoint stops. These are called monitors, and you can learn more
  about the available monitors in the <a href="monitors.html">Breakpoint
  Monitors</a> topic.</p>
