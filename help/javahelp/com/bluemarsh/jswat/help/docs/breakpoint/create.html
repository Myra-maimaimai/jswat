  <h2>Creating Breakpoints</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Creating breakpoints is done using the New Breakpoint dialog box.
  You can open the dialog box by choosing Breakpoint &gt; New
  Breakpoint from the menu bar.</p>

  <p>There are several types of breakpoints that can be created, which
  are described below.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Class</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a class matching a given pattern loads or unloads.
    Since a class may be loaded by multiple class loaders, this may be
    hit more than once.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Exception</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when an exception matching a given pattern is thrown and
    caught or not caught. In Java 5.0, uncaught exceptions are
    difficult to detect and thus this type of breakpoint may not always
    stop when expected.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Line</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a particular line of code in a source file is
    reached. This can only be created by clicking on a line in the
    source viewer.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Method</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a particular method in a class matching a given
    pattern is reached. <em>Note that setting method breakpoints in
    either the instance initializer or constructors is not entirely
    reliable. The Sun JPDA implementation does not properly distinquish
    between the two, so breakpoints in either may, or may not, actually
    stop as expected. Use line breakpoints instead.</em></dd>

    <dt><strong>Thread</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a thread matching a given pattern is started or
    dies.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Trace</strong></dt>

    <dd>Never stops, only shows a brief message in the Output window
    when any method is entered and exited. Produces copious amounts of
    output.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Variable</strong></dt>

    <dd>Stops when a specific field in a class is accessed or
    modified.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Breakpoints support optional actions that are performed when the
  breakpoint stops. These are called monitors, and you can learn more
  about the available monitors in the <a href="monitors.html">Breakpoint
  Monitors</a> topic.</p>
