  <h2>Breakpoint Monitors</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Breakpoint monitors are actions that occur whenever the breakpoint
  is considered to be hit, even if the suspend policy of the breakpoint
  does not cause the debuggee to suspend. Listed below are the available
  monitors for all types of breakpoints.</p>

  <h4>Beep</h4>

  <p>The beep monitor emits a beep sound when the breakpoint is hit.
  This is represented using a checkbox in the breakpoint customizer.
  <em>Note that the <code>java.awt.Toolkit.beep()</code> method does
  not always produce a sound, and depends entirely on your system
  configuration.</em></p>

  <h4>Expression</h4>

  <p>The expression monitor evaluates a Java-like expression each time
  the breakpoint is hit. This is represented using a checkbox and text
  field in the breakpoint customizer.</p>

  <h4>Stack trace</h4>

  <p>The stack trace monitor dumps the event thread call stack to the
  <strong>Output</strong> window when the breakpoint is hit. This is
  represented using a checkbox in the breakpoint customizer.</p>
