  <h2>Editing Breakpoint Groups</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Changes to existing breakpoints groups can be made by selecting the
  group in the <strong>Breakpoints</strong> window and right-clicking on
  it and selecting <em>Customize</em> from the context menu. A dialog
  featuring the breakpoint group customizer will be displayed. When you
  are done, click <em>Ok</em> to save your changes.</p>

  <h3>Groups and Conditions</h3>

  <p>As with breakpoints, it is possible to set a boolean expression to
  act as a condition for a breakpoint group. This condition applies to
  all of the breakpoints contained in that group. So in order for a
  breakpoint to suspend the debuggee, not only must the breakpoint's
  conditions be satisfied, but so must the conditions of the
  breakpoint's group. Likewise, the conditions of the parent of the
  breakpoint group must also be satisfied, and so on, up to the top-most
  breakpoint group. For this reason, it is a good idea to avoid setting
  conditions on the Default group. Otherwise you may wonder why none of
  your breakpoints are stopping when you expect them to.</p>
