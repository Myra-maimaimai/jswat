  <h2>Current Context</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The current context is the location in your application on which
  the debugger is currently focused. When multiple sessions are running,
  only one session is current. Within the current session, the thread
  from which the debugger regained control is the default current
  thread. Inside the current thread, the most recent frame in the stack
  is the default current frame.</p>

  <p>You can make any session, thread, or call current by double-clicking
  its node in the appropriate debugger window.</p>

  <h3>Debugger Windows and Context</h3>

  <p>Most debugger windows depend on the current context. When you
  change the current context, the contents of these windows are updated
  to reflect the new context.</p>

  <p>For example, the Threads window shows the threads in the current
  session, while the Call Stack window shows the call stack for the
  current thread. The Variables window shows the variables that are
  local to the current call, and the Classes window shows the classes
  that have been loaded by the current session.</p>

  <p>One exception is the Watches window. This windows list all watches
  set in the debugger. While the set of watches is shared by all
  sessions, an individual watch expression is evaluated and displayed
  based on the current context.</p>

  <h3>The Source Editor and Context</h3>

  <p>When a variable is active in the current context, the source editor
  displays the value of the variable when you move the mouse pointer
  over it. In cases where a program includes different variables with
  the same name, the source editor displays the value based on the
  current context, and not on the instance of the variable in the source
  code.</p>
