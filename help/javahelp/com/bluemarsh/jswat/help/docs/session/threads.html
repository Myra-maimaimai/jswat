  <h2>Multithread Debugging</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>The following are tips for debugging multi-threading issues.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoint Filters</h3>

  <p>Some of the breakpoints support the application of thread filters.
  A thread filter causes the breakpoint to halt execution of the
  debuggee only when the breakpoint is hit from within the named thread.
  This can be useful for controlling when the breakpoint stops your
  program.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoint Expiration</h3>

  <p>An alternative to using a thread filter is to use a count filter.
  This simply means that you set the breakpoint to stop the debuggee up
  to a certain number of times. This can be used to allow the breakpoint
  to be hit once (or twice, or more) but thereafter it will be
  ignored.</p>

  <p>To reset the breakpoint, simply change its expiration count.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoints Instead of println</h3>

  <p>Since each type of breakpoint displays a message in the Output
  window whenever the breakpoint is hit, it acts similarly to a call to
  <code>println</code>. The breakpoint hit message will always include
  the thread name or unique identifier, so you can easily see which
  threads are reaching a particular location. Just set the breakpoint
  suspend policy to "none" so that the impact on the thread timing in
  the debuggee will be minimal. This can be especially useful if you are
  debugging code that you cannot modify.</p>

  <p><em>Note that some breakpoint monitors cause the debuggee to
  suspend momentarily, such as the expression and stack trace monitors.
  This will possibly affect the thread timing in the debuggee, so avoid
  using these monitors if the breakpoint suspend policy is
  "none".</em></p>

  <h3>Watching Field Changes</h3>

  <p>To catch a thread that is changing a field of a particular object
  instance, you can use a special type of variable breakpoint that is
  set on a per-instance basis. This is done via the <a
  href="../view/variables.html">Variables</a> view context menu. This
  breakpoint will stop whenever the field of a specific instance of a
  class is modified, which can be very useful if the field is changing
  unexpectedly.</p>
