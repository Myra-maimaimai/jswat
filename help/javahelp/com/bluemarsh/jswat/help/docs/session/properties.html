  <h2>Session Settings</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Session settings are set using the Session Settings dialog box.
  You can open the dialog box by choosing Session &gt; Settings from
  the menu bar. Below is a description of the available settings.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt>
    <dd>The session name is a simple moniker of your choosing. You may
    enter any name you like, and it does not have to be unique.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Classes</strong></dt>
    <dd>The entries in the Classes list make up the classpath for the
    debuggee, for those cases where the debuggee is launched from within
    the debugger. If the session is presently connected to the debuggee,
    then this list is read-only and reflects the actual classpath.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Sources</strong></dt>
    <dd>The entries in the Sources list make up the sourcepath for the
    debuggee. See the section below for a more detailed explanation.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Sourcepath</h3>

  <p>For more information on the sourcepath and how it is used, see the
  <a href="paths.html">Classpath and Sourcepath</a> topic.</p>
