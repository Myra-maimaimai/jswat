  <h2>Classpath and Sourcepath</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <h3>Classpath</h3>

  <p>The classpath setting in JSwat is simply the classpath setting for
  the debuggee. If you are launching the debuggee from within JSwat,
  then the classpath must be set in the <a
  href="../action/launch-debuggee.html">Launch dialog</a>. If the
  debuggee was launched outside of JSwat and you are connecting the
  debugger to it, then the classpath has already been set.</p>

  <h3>Sourcepath</h3>

  <p>The sourcepath is like the classpath but rather than pointing to
  compiled classes, it points to source files. The sourcepath is used to
  locate the source code for a class or method whenever a locatable
  event occurs in the debuggee. If a sourcepath is not set, JSwat will
  use the classpath to find the source files, assuming that the source
  code and classes are stored in the same directory tree.</p>

  <p>The sourcepath is defined in the <a href="properties.html">Session
  Settings</a> dialog, activated via the <strong>Settings</strong> item
  in the <strong>Session</strong> menu.</p>

  <p>The sourcepath has the same structure as the classpath, except it
  refers to the location of source code, rather than the location of
  class files. Thus, if you have a classpath that looks like
  <code>/home/me/java/build</code>, which contains <code>.class</code>
  files such as <code>org/mine/Widget.class</code>, and your source code
  is similarly located in a directory such as
  <code>/home/me/project/src</code>, which contains <code>.java</code>
  files such as <code>org/mine/Widget.java</code>, then the sourcepath
  would be set to <code>/home/me/project/src</code>. Note that the
  sourcepath can contain directories as well as archives, such as
  <code>.jar</code> and <code>.zip</code> files.</p>

  <p>For users of Microsoft Windows, the following example may be easier
  to translate to your own environment. Say you have a classpath that
  looks like <code>C:\java\project\build</code>, which contains
  <code>.class</code> files such as <code>org\mine\Widget.class</code>,
  and your source code is similarly located in a directory such as
  <code>C:\java\project\src</code>, which contains <code>.java</code>
  files such as <code>org\mine\Widget.java</code>, then the sourcepath
  would be set to <code>C:\java\project\src</code>.</p>

  <h3>How JSwat Finds Source Code</h3>

  <p>JSwat uses both the classpath and sourcepath to locate source
  files, checking the sourcepath before the classpath. The names of
  source files are determined from the class or method in which a
  locatable event occurred within the debuggee. In most cases, the
  bytecode contains a source file name attribute (and sometimes even a
  leading path), which allows the debugger to easily locate the source
  files. Otherwise, the debugger must guess at the name of the source
  file, assuming that the filename extension is <code>.java</code> and
  the name of the file will be the same as the name of the class (e.g.
  <code>Foobar.java</code> for <code>Foobar</code> class).</p>

  <p>Because JSwat considers the package name of the class to imply the
  path that leads to the source file, it will first attempt to convert
  the package name into a file path. For example, the class name
  <code>java.lang.String</code> would become the path and file
  <code>java/lang/String.java</code>. If JSwat does not find the source
  file, then it will ignore the package name and simply look for a file
  with the appropriate name at the root of each source path (e.g.
  <code>String.java</code>).</p>

  <p>Whenever a locatable event occurs, JSwat attempts to locate and
  display the source code for that location. This occurs whenever a
  breakpoint is hit, and while single-stepping through code. If this
  does not appear to work, check the Troubleshooting section below.</p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

  <p>If it seems that JSwat is not able to locate your source code and
  display it, then there are a few steps you can take to resolve the
  issue.</p>

  <p>First, did you set the sourcepath in the <a
  href="properties.html">Session Settings</a> dialog? Open that dialog
  and look for the Sources section of the settings. Make sure it points
  to the root of your source tree, as explained above.</p>

  <p>Second, is your source code written in the Java language? If not,
  then the filename extension is probably not <code>.java</code>, in
  which case you need to modify the <strong>Source Extension</strong>
  setting in the <strong>Options</strong> dialog (found in the
  <strong>Tools</strong> menu).</p>

  <p>A tool for getting more information about the class you are
  debugging and its source-related attributes is the <code>source</code>
  command. Open the <strong>Commands</strong> view via the
  <strong>Window</strong> menu and type in <kbd>source
  name.of.class</kbd> where <code>name.of.class</code> is the
  fully-qualified name of the class for which JSwat is unable to locate
  the source code. The output of this command will display the value of
  the source file attribute from the class bytecode, as well as the
  leading "source paths", if any. These source paths are not to be
  confused with the JSwat sourcepath setting, as they pertain to this
  particular class only. However, this information can be used to
  understand how the sourcepath setting should be set. For instance,
  with the <code>java.lang.String</code> class, the "source paths" value
  is <code>java/lang/String.java</code> which indicates that the
  sourcepath setting should include the directory which contains the
  <code>java</code> directory of the source code tree. In this case,
  however, it is actually the <code>src.zip</code> file that should be
  entered into the sourcepath setting.</p>

  <p>By the way, the source code for the JDK core classes is discovered
  and automatically added to the sourcepath setting. For more
  information on how to manage this, see the <a
  href="../action/runtime-manager.html">Runtime Manager</a> dialog.</p>
