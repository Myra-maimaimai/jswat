  <h2>Stepping Through Your Program</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Once execution of your program is halted, you can step through your
  lines of code using the following actions in the Stepping menu or
  toolbar:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Step Over (F8)</strong></dt>

    <dd>Executes one source line. If the source line contains a call,
    executes the entire method without stepping through the individual
    lines.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Step Instruction Over</strong></dt>

    <dd>Executes one byte code instruction. If the code invokes a
    method, executes the entire method without stepping through the
    individual instructions.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Step Into (F7)</strong></dt>

    <dd>Executes one source line. If the source line contains a call,
    the IDE stops just before executing the first statement of that
    method.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Step Instruction Into</strong></dt>

    <dd>Executes one byte code instruction. If the code invokes a
    method, the IDE stops just before executing the first code of
    that method.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Step Out (Alt-Shift-F7)</strong></dt>

    <dd>Executes the remaining lines of the method and returns control
    to the caller of the method.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Run to Cursor</strong></dt>

    <dd>Sets a temporary breakpoint at the line of code at which the
    text cursor is currently positioned, and continues execution such
    that the breakpoint will be hit. The breakpoint is then deleted
    once it has been reached.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>While stepping through your program, the current context will be
  updated automatically. Subsequently various debugger windows will also
  be updated to display the relevant information.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>While single-stepping over method calls, or stepping out of a
  method call, breakpoints that are encountered by the debuggee will
  still cause it to be suspended. That is, single-stepping does not
  preclude hitting breakpoints.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Filters</h3>

  <p>Normally when stepping through the code in the debuggee, you may
  step into methods that are not a part of your application. To avoid
  this, you can define a set of stepping exclusions. A stepping exclude
  is a class name, or just a package name, for which you do not want to
  step into code within that class or package.</p>

  <p>The exclusion filters are defined in the <strong>Options</strong>
  dialog, available from the Tools menu. The property is called
  <em>Stepping Excludes</em> and is found under the Debugging/General
  category.</p>

  <p>Examples of exclusion filters would be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>com.sun.*</code></li>
    <li><code>javax.*</code></li>
    <li><code>java.*</code></li>
  </ul>
