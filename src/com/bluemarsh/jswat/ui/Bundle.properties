#
# DESCRIPTION:
#       Resources for this package.
#
#       Tooltips may contain HTML code (but not the HTML tag itself).
#
#       Special characters supported in this resource file by the
#       program (namely the MainWindow class).
#
#        @  - This marks a menu item as a special menu. For example,
#             "@lookAndFeel" would indicate that the program should
#             insert the standard look & feel selection menu at the
#             current point in the menu. Available menus include:
#               lookAndFeel - allows look & feel selection
#
#        -  - Specifies a separator between menu items or toolbar buttons.
#
#        >  - Specifies that the next menu item in a menu definition is
#             really a submenu. Should be the name of the menu definition,
#             just as if you were defining a top-level menu.
