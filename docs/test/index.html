  <h3>Manual Testing</h3>

  <p>Prior versions of JSwat had instructions for manually testing the
  JSwat interface. This, while useful, is a tremendous amount of work
  to develop and maintain, not to mention dreadful to perform.
  Therefore, explicit testing of the interface will not be documented.
  Instead, it is left to the developer to perform his or her own tests,
  as deemed necessary. That is, while developing JSwat, you are
  obligated to perform basic testing to ensure that the features you
  develop actually work.</p>
