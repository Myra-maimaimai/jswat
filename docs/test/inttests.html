  <title>JSwat - Integration Tests</title>

  <h2>Integration Tests</h2>

  <p>To perform testing beyond that of the simple unit tests, there are
  several test classes provided in the <code>tests/integration</code>
  directory. These are short Java classes that exercise some aspect of
  JSwat in order to ensure it is functioning properly. The idea is that
  these tests demonstrate that JSwat as a whole is working as
  expected.</p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>

  <p>These are the same as the requirements for <a href=
  "../dev/compile.html">compiling</a> JSwat.</p>

  <h3>Setting Up</h3>

  <p>As with compiling JSwat, preparations must be made in order to
  compile and run the integration tests. They are as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Follow the instructions for <a href=
    "../dev/compile.html">compiling</a> JSwat.</li>

    <li>Invoke the <em>compile</em> target of the
    <code>build.xml</code> file in the <code>test/integration</code>
    directory. The compiled code will be generated in the
    <code>test/integration/build</code> directory.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Running the Tests</h3>

  <p>After performing all of the preparation, actually running the
  tests involves starting JSwat, initiating a debugging session,
  specifying the classpath and name of the test class, and launching
  the debuggee. From there, it is simply a matter of ensuring that
  JSwat reacts appropriately to the actions of the test code. Below are
  descriptions of the test classes and how they are expected to
  operate, and in what way JSwat should behave.</p>

  <h4>ClickMe</h4>

  <p>This class creates a window containing a button and waits for the
  button to be pressed, at which point the button label is changed to
  indicate the number of times it was pressed. This class is good for
  testing the behavior of the Variables view after the debuggee has hit
  a breakpoint and subsequently resumed. In that case, expanding a node
  in the Variables view should either work correctly, or do nothing. In
  other words, there should not be an exception just because the
  debuggee is no longer suspended.</p>

  <h4>DeepStack</h4>

  <p>This simple class is used for testing the call stack top component
  in JSwat. To test the call stack, open the source for
  <code>DeepStack</code> and set a breakpoint in the
  <code>subroutine_4()</code> method (the last method in the call
  chain). Then start a session for the <code>DeepStack</code> class and
  resume so as to hit the breakpoint. Make sure the JSwat call stack
  window is open and ensure that it shows the thread stack as would be
  expected (e.g. entry on the top should be <code>subroutine_4()</code>
  and <code>main()</code> should be at the bottom).</p>

  <p>The call stack supports a few actions, including showing the
  source code for a particular frame, and setting a frame as the
  current in the debugging context. Showing the source will open the
  corresponding source file and scroll to the line for that frame.
  Setting the current frame will make the icon for that frame have a
  bold outline, and change the debugging context (i.e. the Variables
  view will show the variables in that frame).</p>

  <h4>InAndOut</h4>

  <p>This class is very simple and demonstrates the proper functioning
  of the &quot;Process Output&quot; window. This includes displaying
  the output from the <code>InAndOut</code> class as well as sending
  input to that class. Input is sent to the debuggee via the input
  field in the &quot;Process Output&quot; window.</p>

  <p>When this class is executed, you should see a message to the
  standard output, a message to standard error, and then a prompt for
  input. The class will wait indefinitely for that input. Once provided
  with input, it will display the input value and a final message
  before exiting.</p>

  <h4>Librarian</h4>

  <p>All this class does is import some classes from the JDI external
  library in order to print the JDI version number to the console. The
  purpose of this is to confirm that if the session classpath is not
  appropriately set, the source editor will indicate that the classes
  cannot be found (the red error stripes). After setting the classpath
  to include the <code>tools.jar</code> file included in the JDK
  <code>lib</code> directory, the error stripes should immediately
  disappear.</p>

  <h4>Overloaded</h4>

  <p>Use this class to test the method breakpoints and their ability to
  stop at any or all of the methods in the class. By defining a method
  breakpoint with no method name, the breakpoint will stop at all of
  the methods in the class. Likewise, defining a method breakpoint with
  a method name but no parameters will stop at all methods by the given
  name.</p>

  <h4>PackRat</h4>

  <p>This code is used for testing the Variables view, to ensure that
  the view updates the variable values appropriately, shows the correct
  value types, and displays arrays in a suitable manner. Test the
  Variables view by setting breakpoints in various methods of
  <code>PackRat</code> and stepping through the code. You should see
  the values of variables changing in the Variables view. Expand some
  of the nodes in the Variables view and observe that object references
  will show their fields as child nodes, and array references will show
  the elements as child nodes.</p>

  <h4>Pitcher</h4>

  <p>This code throws exceptions and is useful for testing the
  exception breakpoints. Test this by setting an exception breakpoint
  for <code>java.net.MalformedURLException</code> and debugging the
  <code>Pitcher</code> class. The exception breakpoint should suspend
  the debuggee at the point where the exception is caught. Resume the
  debuggee and it should stop again when the uncaught exceptions are
  thrown.</p>

  <h4>SetFielder</h4>

  <p>This class has two fields whose values are changed and is used for
  testing the watch breakpoints. Test this by setting a watch
  breakpoint for each of the two fields in the <code>SetFielder</code>
  class. The debuggee should suspend when each of these fields is
  accessed and modified by the debuggee.</p>

  <h4>Snoozer</h4>

  <p>The Snoozer class creates several threads and has them sleep for
  several seconds each. This is used for testing the thread
  breakpoints. It can also be used to test single-stepping through code
  that is being executed by multiple threads simultaneously. Test this
  by creating a thread breakpoint with a thread filter value of
  &quot;abc&quot;. The breakpoint should be hit just one time, when the
  &quot;abc&quot; thread is started. Single-stepping should proceed
  normally, unless the thread breakpoint does not have a thread filter.
  It is also possible to test line breakpoint thread filters in the
  same way.</p>
