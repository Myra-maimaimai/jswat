  <h2>Remote Debugging</h2>

  <h3>Attaching to a Running Program</h3>

  <p>To debug a program that is already running, you must have started
  that program using the following command line:</p>
  <pre>
% java -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n &lt;class&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This will start the JPDA debugger back-end and run the given
  class. The socket transport will be used and the back-end will act as
  the server. This allows JSwat to connect to the debugger back-end by
  using the &#39;<code>attach</code>&#39; JSwat command. The debugger
  back-end will print a four-digit number in the command shell where
  you invoked &#39;<code>java</code>&#39;. This is the socket port
  number that JSwat must connect to.</p>

  <p>Once you have started JSwat and the debuggee program is running,
  you can type &quot;<code>attach &lt;port&gt;</code>&quot; to attach
  to the debugger back-end through the given port number. JSwat should
  say &quot;VM attached&quot; when successful.</p>

  <h3>Detaching from a Running Program</h3>

  <p>To end the remote debugging session, invoke the command
  &#39;<code>detach</code>&#39; or &#39;<code>close</code>&#39;. Either
  one of these commands will close the connection with the debuggee VM
  and leave it running. If you invoke the &#39;<code>kill</code>&#39;
  command instead, this will terminate the debuggee VM.</p>

  <h3>Listening for a Connection</h3>

  <p>In addition to connecting to an already running remote VM, JSwat
  can listen for connections from new VMs. This is done using the
  &#39;<code>listen</code>&#39; command. It takes an optional port
  number to listen to, or uses a default as generated by the JPDA.
  While JSwat is listening for a remote VM to connect, you may launch
  the remote debuggee using something like the following:</p>
  <pre>
% java -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=&lt;port&gt; &lt;class&gt;
</pre>

  <p>For the <code>&lt;port&gt;</code> value, substitute the value
  returned from the &#39;<code>listen</code>&#39; command. Enter the
  name of the class you want to debug in place of the
  <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> argument. Once the remote VM starts up,
  JSwat will activate a new debugging session and will be ready for
  your input.</p>

  <h3>For More Information</h3>

  <p>Please see the documentation available for the JPDA library,
  included with JDK documentation for JDK 1.3 and above. Be sure to
  read about the JPDA connectors to learn all the options for remote
  debugging.</p>
