    <h3>Classes</h3>

    <p>The loaded classes of the debuggee are displayed in the
    &quot;Classes&quot; panel. The classes are shown in the form of a
    tree, starting with the top-level package names (e.g.
    &quot;com&quot;, &quot;java&quot;, &quot;org&quot;).
    Double-clicking on a class will cause its source file to be opened.
    An error will occur if JSwat cannot find the source file. This is
    generally caused by a missing or incorrect sourcepath setting. See
    the section on <a href="paths.html">Classpath and Sourcepath</a>
    for more information.</p>

    <p>The class tree display may include a number in parentheses
    behind some of the class names. This number indicates the unique
    object identifier of the class loader that loaded the class. This
    is helpful when writing custom class loaders. <em>Note: the number
    will be different each time the debuggee is started.</em></p>
