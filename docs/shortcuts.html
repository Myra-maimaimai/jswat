  <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

  <h3>Using the Shortcuts</h3>

  <p>Keyboard shortcuts are simply keyboard equivalents for invoking
  certain menu items. For instance, the single step menu item can be
  invoked using the mouse by clicking on the &quot;Step&quot; menu and
  selecting the &quot;Single Step&quot; item. In addition to using the
  mouse, there should be a keyboard key that is also assigned to invoke
  that menu item. By default it is the F11 key. On most user
  interfaces, the shortcut keys are indicated in the menu itself. Next
  to the words &quot;Single Step&quot; you should see a
  &quot;F11&quot;.</p>

  <h3>Reassigning the Shortcuts</h3>

  <p>To change the keys used to invoke menu items, use the Preferences
  feature of JSwat. This is found under the &quot;Options&quot; menu
  and will bring up a dialog containing various JSwat settings. Select
  the &quot;Shortcuts&quot; item to see the assignable keyboard
  shortcuts. There are presently only a small set of menu items with
  keyboard shortcuts, but over time this will improve.</p>

  <p>The allowable values for keyboard shortcuts are defined by the
  <code>javax.swing.KeyStroke().getKeyStroke(String)</code> method.
  That information is reprinted here for your convenience.</p>

  <p>The keystroke string has the following syntax:</p>
  <pre>
     &lt;modifiers&gt;* (&lt;typedID&gt; | &lt;pressedReleasedID&gt;)
     modifiers := shift | control | meta | alt | button1 | button2 | button3
     typedID := typed &lt;typedKey&gt;
     typedKey := string of length 1 giving Unicode character.
     pressedReleasedID := (pressed | released)? key
     key := KeyEvent keycode name, i.e. the name following &quot;VK_&quot;.
</pre>

  <p>If typed, pressed or released is not specified, pressed is
  assumed. The button1, button2, and button3 modifiers refer to the
  respective mouse buttons. Here are some examples:</p>
  <pre>
     &quot;INSERT&quot;
     &quot;control DELETE&quot;
     &quot;alt shift X&quot;
     &quot;alt shift released X&quot;
     &quot;typed a&quot;
</pre>

  <h3>Reserved Key Combinations</h3>

  <p>The Java Foundation Classes, the component set used by JSwat to
  build the graphical interface, seems to reserve some key
  combinations. In particular:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>F6, F8 - accessibility hot keys.</li>

    <li>F10 - opens the first menu in the menubar.</li>
  </ul>
