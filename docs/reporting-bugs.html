  <h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

  <h3>I Found A Bug!</h3>

  <p>First and foremost, confirm that you really found a new bug. To do
  this, follow the steps outlined below. This should not take long.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Check the list of <a href=
    "http://www.bluemarsh.com/bugzilla/">known bugs</a> to make sure
    this has not already been found and reported by someone else.</li>

    <li>Are you using the latest version of JSwat? If not, you probably
    ought to try to reproduce the problem using the latest version. The
    bug may have been found and fixed already.</li>

    <li>Read the JSwat documentation carefully. There isn&#39;t much
    and it will be worth your time.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If after all that it seems like you have found a new bug, please
  send as much of the following information as you possibly can to the

  mailing list.</p>
