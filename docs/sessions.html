  <title>JSwat - Sessions</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h2>Sessions</h2>

  <h3>What are Sessions?</h3>

  <p>A JSwat Session is the object that manages the debuggee VM from
  the standpoint of the debugger. It launches a debuggee or connects to
  a remote debuggee. A Session can suspend and resume a debuggee. The
  Session also keeps a variety of persistent properties.</p>

  <p>At present JSwat supports only one open session at a time.</p>

  <h3>Session Properties</h3>

  <p>The properties of a Session include the classpath, sourcepath,
  list of excludes, last-used search phrase, watchpoints, main class,
  remote host and port, JVM options and so on. All of these properties
  are initially empty until they are defined during normal interaction
  with JSwat. When JSwat exits it automatically saves the properties to
  a file on disk. The next time JSwat starts, it reads those properties
  from the file.</p>

  <p>JSwat has basic support for multiple sets of Session properties.
  That is, the current Session properties can be saved to an arbitrary
  file and later recalled. This is done through the &quot;Open
  Session&quot; and &quot;Save Session&quot; menu items in the
  &quot;File&quot; menu.</p>
