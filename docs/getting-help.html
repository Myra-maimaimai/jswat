  <h2>Getting Help</h2>

  <h3>Help!</h3>

  <p>So you have downloaded JSwat and hoped it would solve your
  debugging needs, but alas, something is not working as you expected.
  Well, do not fret. Read this useful list of tips on how to get help,
  as well as how to help yourself.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>First, did you read the documentation? If you have not read
    every page of the <a href="index.html">documentation</a>, you may
    very well have missed something. Please read all of the
    documentation before continuing. There is not that much so it
    should not take long.</li>

    <li>Second, did you check the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)? If
    not, please have a <a href=
    "http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/docs/faq.html">look</a> before
    asking questsions.</li>

    <li>Use the <code>help</code> command. All of the JSwat commands
    have a built-in help function. If you have a question about a JSwat
    command, this is a good start.</li>

    <li>Ask for help. There are two avenues for asking questions about
    JSwat. The first is to email the <a href=
    "mailto:nfiedler@bluemarsh.com">author</a> and the second is to
    send the question to the <a href=
    "http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/mail-lists.html">jswat-user</a>
    mailing list. If you choose either of these options, you will get a
    quicker resolution to your problem if you provide the following
    information along with your question:

      <ul>
        <li>Operating System (e.g. Windows, Linux, Solaris)</li>

        <li>JDK version (e.g. 1.2.2, 1.3.1, or 1.4.0)</li>

        <li>JDK brand (e.g. Sun, IBM, Blackdown)</li>

        <li>JSwat version (hopefully the latest)</li>

        <li>Your classpath and sourcepath settings</li>

        <li>What you were trying to do</li>

        <li>The steps you followed</li>

        <li>Any pertinent error messages</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
