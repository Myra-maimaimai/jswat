  <h2>JSwat Debugger</h2>

  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jswat/">JSwat</a> is a graphical
  Java debugger front-end, written for the <a href=
  "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/">Java Platform</a>, utilizing the
  Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA), and the <a href=
  "http://www.netbeans.org/features/platform/">NetBeans Platform</a>.
  The source code is licensed under the <a href=
  "http://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0">Common Development and Distribution
  License</a>.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <h3>Java SE with JPDA</h3>

  <p>JSwat requires the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/">Java
  Platform, Standard Edition</a>, version 6.0 or higher. It is
  possible, although not necessarily recommended, to use compatible
  software from other vendors. In any case, the selected Java SE must
  contain the JPDA software. The required classes, defined in the
  <code>com.sun.jdi</code> package, are typically found in a file
  called <code>tools.jar</code>.</p>

  <p><em>Note that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) does not contain
  the JPDA and therefore will not run JSwat properly. You must use the
  Java Development Kit (JDK) to run JSwat.</em></p>

  <h3>Compile for debugging</h3>

  <p>When debugging Java code, it is necessary to compile the classes
  using the <kbd>-g</kbd> option to <code>javac</code>. Additionally,
  do not compile the classes with the optimization flags, as that may
  hinder debugging. If you use <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache
  Ant</a> to compile your application, set the <code>debug</code> value
  of the <code>javac</code> task to <em>on</em> and either leave the
  <code>debuglevel</code> value undefined, or use the value
  <em>vars,lines,source</em> so as to generate all of the necessary
  debugging information in the compiled classes.</p>

  <h2>Starting JSwat</h2>

  <p>Starting the debugger amounts to invoking a small launcher. There
  are two methods for this and the choice depends on your system.</p>

  <h4>Microsoft Windows</h4>

  <p>If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can double-click on the
  <strong><code>jswat.exe</code></strong> launcher in the
  <code>bin</code> directory, or invoke it from the command line.</p>

  <h4>Unix-like systems</h4>

  <p>On Unix-like systems such as BSD, Linux, Mac OS X, or Solaris,
  simply invoke the shell script <strong><code>jswat</code></strong> in
  the <code>bin</code> directory.</p>

  <h3>Startup options</h3>

  <p>The JSwat launcher is basically a renamed version of the NetBeans
  Platform launcher, thus it supports the same command-line options.
  For a list of these options and a brief explanation, invoke the
  launcher with the <code>--help</code> switch.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

  <p>The JSwat documentation consists of a <a href=
  "UsersGuide.html">User&#39;s Guide</a>, the built-in help found in
  the <strong>Help</strong> menu in the main program window, and in
  several &quot;how to&quot; documents on the <a href=
  "http://code.google.com/p/jswat/">web site</a>.</p>

  <h2>Stopping JSwat</h2>

  <p>The correct way to exit JSwat is with either the window close
  button or the <strong>Exit</strong> item in the <strong>File</strong>
  menu. Using <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> to kill JSwat will likely cause
  problems and should be avoided. It must <em>only</em> be used in
  cases where the JVM hosting JSwat has frozen. If the JSwat interface
  appears frozen, chances are that terminating the debuggee, via the
  appropriate system operation, will allow JSwat to return to
  normal.</p>

  <h2>Removing JSwat</h2>

  <p>Removing JSwat from your system is generally pretty simple. Find
  the files, wherever it is that you originally put them, and delete
  them. If you used one of the packaged versions you should remove the
  package using the appropriate system command. In addition to the
  program files, there are user settings stored in a directory named
  <code>.jswat</code> in your home directory.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading from earlier versions</h2>

  <p>The settings from the 2.x versions of JSwat may be safely removed
  &mdash; in other words, they are ignored by version 3.0 and later.
  These resided in one of two places, depending on which operating
  system you are using.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Under <code>.java/.userPrefs/com/bluemarsh/jswat/</code> in
    your Unix home directory.</li>

    <li>Under
    <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/JavaSoft/Prefs/com/bluemarsh/jswat</code>
    in the Windows registry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The 1.x versions of JSwat stored their settings in a directory
  called <code>.jswat</code> in your home directory. However, the 3.x
  versions of JSwat also store their settings in this directory, so you
  should <em>not</em> simply delete this directory. Instead, you can
  remove the 1.x files only, leaving the rest intact. They are named
  <code>breakpoints</code>, <code>session</code>, and
  <code>settings</code> and can be safely removed.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading the JDK</h2>

  <p>If at some point you replace your current JDK installation with a
  different version, you will need to update the JSwat configuration
  file. This is done by opening the <code>etc/jswat.conf</code> file in
  a text editor and changing the <code>netbeans_jdkhome</code> value to
  point to the new JDK installation directory. An alternative to
  editing the configuration file is to pass the <code>--jdkhome</code>
  option when starting JSwat. This option takes a single argument,
  which is the path to the JDK installation.</p>

  <h2>Getting source code</h2>

  <p>The source code for each release of JSwat is distributed via the
  same web site as the binary download. To get the very latest source
  code you must use a <a href="http://git-scm.org/">Git</a> client to
  access the source repository. See the project <a href=
  "http://code.google.com/p/jswat/">web site</a> for more information
  on utilizing the source code repository.</p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3>Debugging Features Disappeared</h3>

  <p>There are multiple causes for this behavior.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The JSwat modules require Java 6.0 or higher, and when the
    debugger is launched using an earlier JDK, the JSwat modules will
    automatically be disabled. To rectify the situation, you will need
    to exit and start again using JDK 6.0 or higher (see section above
    regarding upgrading the JDK), and then re-enable the JSwat modules.
    This is done using the <strong>Plugins</strong> manager which is
    found in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Check the boxes next to
    each of the JSwat modules to enable them. Everything should be back
    to normal at that point, allowing you to debug using JSwat.</li>

    <li>If the debugger used to work and now appears to have lost all
    of the debugging features, it may be that the software packages on
    your system have been updated and created an incompatibility. One
    possible solution is to (re)move the <tt>~/.jswat</tt> directory
    and start JSwat again. You will lose your serialized settings, but
    chances are that will resolve the problem.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Slow Performance on Linux</h3>

  <p>Due to a change in Linux kernel 2.6.15, the Sun JPDA
  implementation is adversely affected in terms of network performance.
  This causes all Java debuggers based on JPDA to perform very, very
  slowly. There are a few possible solutions to this problem.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Downgrade to kernel 2.6.14 or lower</li>

    <li>Upgrade to JDK 6.0 build 79 or higher</li>

    <li>Invoke <code>sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_abc=0</code> to
    effectively reverse the change made in the Linux kernel. <em>Note
    that this may incur a security risk; speak with your system
    administrator if you are at all concerned.</em></li>
  </ul>
