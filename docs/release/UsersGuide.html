  <h2>Window management</h2>

  <p>The display areas within the main JSwat window are themselves
  called windows. These windows display the variables, threads,
  classes, breakpoints, sessions, and so on. Initially not all of the
  windows are visible, so you may want to peruse the
  <strong>Window</strong> menu to look for the other available windows.
  To arrange the windows within the main window, click on the title bar
  of the window and drag it to a different location. You will see a
  colorful outline that indicates where the window will be displayed
  when you release the mouse button. You can change the size of the
  windows in relation to one another by dragging the dividers between
  the window areas (an area is a collection of windows which occupy the
  same space, referred to as &quot;modes&quot; in NetBeans
  terminology).</p>

  <h2>Starting the debuggee</h2>

  <p>To start debugging your code, you may launch your application from
  within the debugger, or start it separately and connect the debugger
  as needed. The launching dialog is generally appropriate for small
  applications with a simple launching mechanism, whereas you would use
  the attaching method if the application has a launcher of its own, or
  requires significant setup.</p>

  <h3>Launching</h3>

  <p>To launch the debuggee, select <strong>Start</strong> from the
  <strong>Session</strong> menu (or click on the corresponding toolbar
  button). The dialog that appears has a <strong>Help</strong> button
  that will display the help page to explain all of the input fields.
  You must provide the name of your application&#39;s main class, as
  well as the classpath that is normally used to launch your
  application.</p>

  <p>Once the debuggee is launched, it is in a paused state, waiting
  for you to signal it to start. To start the debuggee, select
  <strong>Continue</strong> from the <strong>Session</strong> menu (or
  click on the corresponding toolbar button). The debuggee will run
  until it hits a breakpoint, or it exits normally.</p>

  <h3>Attaching</h3>

  <p>Attaching to a debuggee after it has been launched requires that
  the debuggee was launched with certain debugging flags. Examples for
  each of the different JDK versions are shown below.</p>

  <table summary="debug flags" border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>JDK Version</th>

      <th>Debug Flags</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>1.2, 1.3</td>

      <td><code>-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE
      -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5000</code></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>1.4</td>

      <td><code>-Xdebug
      -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5000</code></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>1.5, 1.6</td>

      <td>
      <code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5000</code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>You are free to use a different number for the
  <code>address</code> value, as long as it is between 1024 and 65535,
  inclusive, and not already in use by another program. Alternately, if
  you are using Microsoft Windows you can choose to use the shared
  memory transport instead of the sockets transport. Do this by
  changing the <code>dt_socket</code> to <code>dt_shmem</code> and the
  <code>address</code> value to some name, such as
  <code>jpdaconn</code>.</p>

  <p>Once the debuggee has been launched with the flags shown above,
  select <strong>Attach</strong> from the <strong>Session</strong> menu
  (or click on the corresponding toolbar button). The host field can be
  left blank to default to the local machine, otherwise you can enter
  either a machine name or an IP address. If a name is entered, the
  name must be resolvable by the networking interface on the local
  machine. For the port number field, you should enter the number given
  as the <code>address</code> in the debug flags (e.g. 5000). If you
  used the shared memory transport, then select the shared memory
  option from the <strong>Transport</strong> field in the attach
  dialog, and enter the name from the <code>address</code> option in
  the debug flags</p>

  <p>If the debuggee was launched with <code>suspend=y</code> then you
  may start the debuggee by selecting <strong>Continue</strong> from
  the <strong>Session</strong> menu (or click on the corresponding
  toolbar button). The debuggee will run until it hits a breakpoint, or
  it exits normally.</p>

  <h2>Setting the classpath and sourcepath</h2>

  <p>You probably have already set the classpath for your application
  when you launched it, either from the debugger or in a separate
  command window. In any case, you can inspect the classpath via the
  <strong>Settings</strong> item in the <strong>Session</strong> menu.
  Note that while the session is connected to the debuggee, you will be
  prevented from modifying the classpath, since it is impossible to
  modify the classpath of a running JVM.</p>

  <p>In addition to the classpath, you can use the Settings dialog to
  specify the directories and archives containing the source code for
  your application. This is referred to as the sourcepath. The
  sourcepath has the same structure as the classpath, except it refers
  to the location of source code, rather than the location of class
  files. Thus, if you have a classpath that looks like
  <code>/home/me/java/build</code>, which contains <code>.class</code>
  files such as <code>org/mine/Widget.class</code>, and your source
  code is similarly located in a directory such as
  <code>/home/me/project/src</code>, which contains <code>.java</code>
  files such as <code>org/mine/Widget.java</code>, then the sourcepath
  would be set to <code>/home/me/project/src</code>. Note that the
  sourcepath can contain directories as well as archives, such as
  <code>.jar</code> and <code>.zip</code> files.</p>

  <h2>Setting breakpoints</h2>

  <p>To set breakpoints, use the debugger to open the source file
  containing the code in which you want to stop. Scroll the editor to
  the desired line, then click the mouse in the gray margin on the left
  side of the editor view. Clicking in the margin will create a line
  breakpoint, and clicking on the line breakpoint icon will remove the
  breakpoint.</p>

  <p>Additional types of breakpoints may be created from the
  <strong>Breakpoint</strong> menu, including class, exception, method,
  thread, trace, and variable breakpoints. The dialog for creating
  breakpoints has a <strong>Help</strong> button that displays a help
  topic explaining the various input fields.</p>

  <h2>Stepping through code</h2>

  <p>Once the debuggee has been launched and it hits a breakpoint, you
  can begin stepping through the code. Do this by selecting one of the
  items in the <strong>Stepping</strong> menu. The <strong>Step
  Into</strong> item will perform a single-step operation, stepping
  into method calls, while <strong>Step Over</strong> will step through
  the method call in one action. <strong>Step Out</strong> will finish
  the current method and stop at the calling method. <strong>Run to
  Cursor</strong> will set a breakpoint at the current cursor location,
  resume the debuggee so that it will hit the breakpoint, and then
  automatically delete the breakpoint.</p>

  <p>As with many of the other menu items, there are corresponding
  keyboard shortcuts. Look at the menu items to see the current
  keyboard shortcut assignments for each item.</p>

  <h2>Displaying variable values</h2>

  <p>There are three ways in which to view the values of variables. The
  first is with the <strong>Variables</strong> window, which shows all
  local variables, as well as the fields of the current object. This
  display is automatically updated each time the debuggee hits a
  breakpoint, as well as when you step through your code.</p>

  <p>In addition to that view, there is the editor tooltip, whereby the
  value of the variable under the mouse pointer will be displayed as a
  tooltip in the source editor. Naturally, this requires having a
  source file open in the editor that contains references to the
  desired variables. This also requires that the debuggee has stopped
  at a breakpoint in order for the evaluator to have a current thread
  and stack frame from which to evaluate the variable reference.</p>

  <p>The third option is to use the <strong>Evaluator</strong> view.
  You can type any Java-like expression (with a few minor omissions,
  such as ternary operators and the <code>new</code> and
  <code>super</code> keywords) and it will be evaluated and the result
  displayed in the window. This requires that the debuggee has stopped
  at a breakpoint in order to evaluate any variable references.</p>

  <h2>Flashing red icon</h2>

  <p>When you see a flashing red icon in the lower right corner of the
  main window, that indicates that an unexpected error occurred. Click
  the icon to see an explanation, along with a stack trace. If such an
  error prevents you from debugging properly, please send the error
  message and stack trace to
  <code>jswat-discuss@googlegroups.com</code> so the problem can be
  entered into the bug tracking system.</p>
