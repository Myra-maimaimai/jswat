    <h3>Threads, Call Stack</h3>

    <p>The debuggee threads are displayed in the &quot;Threads&quot;
    panel. The <code>threads</code> command will also display the
    threads of the debuggee.</p>

    <h4>Current Thread</h4>

    <p>JSwat has a notion of a &quot;current&quot; thread. That is, the
    thread upon which various operations are performed. The current
    thread is set automatically when the debuggee hits a breakpoint of
    any kind. Otherwise, the current thread can be set manually using
    the <code>thread</code> command. It can also be set by clicking on
    the thread in the &quot;Threads&quot; panel.</p>

    <p>The current thread is indicated in the &quot;Threads&quot; panel
    by drawing it in the color red. The <code>threads</code> command
    uses the asterisk (*) character to indicate the current thread.</p>

    <p>Any operations which require the current thread to be set will
    report an error message if the current thread has not been set.</p>

    <h4>Call Stack</h4>

    <p>When the debuggee is suspended and the current thread is set,
    the call stack is displayed in the &quot;Stack&quot; panel. The
    stack can also be displayed using the <code>where</code>
    command.</p>

    <p>Whenever a breakpoint is hit, the current stack frame is set to
    zero. The current frame can be changed by double-clicking on the
    entry in the &quot;Stack&quot; panel. This has the side-effect of
    opening the source file for the location given by that frame. The
    current stack frame can also be changed using the <code>up</code>,
    <code>down</code>, or <code>frame</code> commands.</p>
