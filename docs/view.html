    <h3>Source View</h3>

    <p>The source view is the most sophisticated part of JSwat. It uses
    a Java language parser to colorize the lexical elements of the
    file, identify the locations and names of the defined classes, and
    determine the locations of all of the methods. It uses a popup menu
    to manage breakpoints and scroll to method definitions.</p>
    <a name="gutter"></a> 

    <h4>The Gutter</h4>

    <p>The gutter is the place where the line numbers are shown, on the
    left side of the source view. The background color is used to
    indicate the location of breakpoints. The default light gray
    indicates that line does not have a breakpoint. The other colors
    are defined as follows:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Red</strong></dt>

      <dd>Expired; hit count reached &#39;expire count&#39;.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Gray</strong></dt>

      <dd>Disabled by user.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Blue</strong></dt>

      <dd>Unresolved; waiting for class to load.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Yellow</strong></dt>

      <dd>Skipping hits until &#39;skip count&#39; is reached.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Green</strong></dt>

      <dd>Ready to be hit.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Current Location</h4>

    <p>The current location is like the current thread (see <a href= 
    "threads.html">Threads, Call Stack</a>). It is set whenever a
    breakpoint is hit and indicates the line about to be executed in
    the debuggee. The line is indicated in the source view using a blue
    highlight across that line. Changing the current thread or stack
    frame will move the highlight to the corresponding line of the
    appropriate source view.</p>

    <h4>Searching</h4>

    <p>You can search for words and phrases in the source view by using
    the &quot;Search Source&quot; menu item in the &quot;View&quot;
    menu (or the toolbar button with the binoculars). In the Find
    dialog, simply enter the word or phrase you are looking for, then
    click Ok. To ignore letter casing, select the checkbox
    provided.</p>

    <h4>Options</h4>

    <p>There are a number of options affecting the view, which include
    the following. They are specified in the &quot;View&quot; category
    of the user preferences dialog.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Colorize</strong></dt>

      <dd>This enables or disables the use of a Java lexical analyzer
      to determine the locations of all of the tokens in the source
      file. This information, when enabled, is used to colorize the
      source code. You may want to disable this if you usually view
      files that are not Java source code.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Parse as Java</strong></dt>

      <dd>This enables or disables the use of a Java language parser to
      determine the locations of all of the classes and methods in the
      source file. This information, when enabled, is used to set
      breakpoints and scroll to method definitions. You may want to
      disable this if you usually view files that are not Java source
      code.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Maximize</strong></dt>

      <dd>When enabled, the source view windows will be maximized when
      they are first opened.</dd>
