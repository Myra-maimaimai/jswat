  <h2>JSwat Breakpoints</h2>

  <h3>How to Set Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>JSwat supports setting breakpoints inside classes, including inner
  classes. Breakpoints can be set in at least two ways using JSwat.
  First there is the command &#39;<code>stop</code>&#39; which can be
  used to set a breakpoint at a method in a class or at a code line in
  the class. Second, there is the &quot;New Breakpoint&quot; item in
  the &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu, and finally there is a button in
  the toolbar. This presents a dialog which allows you to set a
  breakpoint at a code line in a class.</p>

  <p>For using the &#39;<code>stop</code>&#39; command, type
  &#39;<code>help stop</code>&#39; to learn the syntax for the command.
  It is generally of the form &quot;<code>stop
  &lt;class&gt;:&lt;line&gt;</code>&quot; where &lt;class&gt; is the
  name of a class and &lt;line&gt; is the code line at which to set the
  breakpoint. To set a breakpoint inside an inner class, use the dollar
  sign ($) to separate the names of the outer and inner classes. Some
  examples are:</p>
  <pre>
&gt; stop MyClass:213
&gt; stop mypackage.MyClass.myMethod(java.lang.String, int)
&gt; stop *.ClassName$Inner:41
</pre>

  <p>The second example demonstrates setting a breakpoint at a method,
  by giving the method name and argument types. You do not give the
  argument names, just the fully-qualified argument types.</p>

  <h3>What Breakpoints Do I Have Set?</h3>

  <p>Any breakpoints that have been set and resolved are assigned
  numbers. The numbers assigned to a breakpoint remain in effect for
  the life of the breakpoint. To see the breakpoints and their numbers,
  use the &#39;<code>stop</code>&#39; command with no arguments. To see
  the breakpoints in a dialog, select the &quot;Breakpoints...&quot;
  menu item. There is also the panel labeled
  &quot;Breakpoints&quot;.</p>

  <p>Breakpoints are also visually displayed in the source code viewer.
  The breakpoints are displayed by colorizing the area on the left
  margin of the source window. Resolved breakpoints are colored with
  green and disabled breakpoints are gray. Breakpoints that have
  expired are red. Unresolved breakpoints are blue. Breakpoints that
  are skipping hits are yellow.</p>

  <h3>How to Disable/Enable Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>There are at least three ways to disable and enable breakpoints.
  The first is through the &#39;<code>disable</code>&#39; and
  &#39;<code>enable</code>&#39; commands. These each take the number of
  the breakpoint (as described above) to disable or enable.</p>

  <p>Another way to disable or enable breakpoints is to use the
  &quot;Breakpoints...&quot; menu item. This presents a dialog that
  shows all the set breakpoints. Select a breakpoint in the dialog and
  click either the &quot;Disable&quot; or &quot;Enable&quot; button, as
  desired.</p>

  <p>Yet another way to disable and enable breakpoints is by using the
  source code viewer. If a source file is displayed which contains
  breakpoints, you can right click on the code line with the breakpoint
  and a popup menu will appear. This menu has items to disable, enable,
  and remove breakpoints.</p>

  <h3>How to Clear Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>There are at least three ways to clear breakpoints. The first is
  through the &#39;<code>clear</code>&#39; command. This takes the
  number of the breakpoint (as described above) to remove.</p>

  <p>Another way to clear breakpoints is to use the &quot;List
  Breakpoints&quot; menu item and the &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu.
  This presents a dialog that shows all the set breakpoints. Select a
  breakpoint and click the &quot;Remove&quot; button to remove the
  breakpoint.</p>

  <p>Yet another way to clear breakpoints is by using the source code
  viewer. If a source file is displayed which contains breakpoints, you
  can right click on the code line with the breakpoint and a popup menu
  will appear. This menu has items to disable, enable, and remove
  breakpoints.</p>

  <h3>Grouping Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>Breakpoints are automatically added to a breakpoint group called
  &quot;Default&quot;. Via the breakpoints manager dialog (accessible
  via the &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu) it is possible to create new
  breakpoint groups and move breakpoints to that group. Breakpoint
  groups can be disabled, causing all of the breakpoints contained
  within them to also be disabled. Re-enabling the group will restore
  the breakpoints to their original enabled state.</p>

  <p>Breakpoint groups can contain other groups, which may contain yet
  other groups.</p>

  <p>Deleting a breakpoint group will delete all of the breakpoints and
  groups contained therein.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Default&quot; breakpoint group cannot be deleted and it
  will be automatically re-enabled whenever a session is restarted.</p>

  <h3>Skipping and Expiration</h3>

  <p>All breakpoints support the notion of skipping and expiration.
  Skipping means that a breakpoint will be hit but will immediately
  resume execution of the debuggee VM until the breakpoint has been hit
  enough times. A skip value of zero means the breakpoint will not skip
  at all. Expiration is when a breakpoint has been hit enough times
  that it is no longer useful. This is the inverse of skipping, where
  the breakpoint will halt execution of the VM until the breakpoint
  expires. An expiration value of zero means the breakpoint will never
  expire.</p>

  <p>If the skip value is larger than the expiration value (assuming
  the expiration value is non-zero), the breakpoint will effectively
  never halt execution of the debuggee VM.</p>

  <h3>Manipulating Multiple Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>This is very easy to do. Simply select all of the breakpoints you
  want to modify in the breakpoints panel, then select the button to
  modify them. You can enable, disable, and remove multiple breakpoints
  just be selecting them.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoint Conditions</h3>

  <p>Breakpoints may have one or more conditions assigned to them,
  allowing you to avoid hitting the breakpoint more often than is
  necessary. Presently only one type of breakpoint condition is
  supported, called a &quot;value&quot; condition. The condition is
  satisfied when the named variable (e.g. &quot;obj1.fieldx&quot;)
  equals a particular value (e.g. &quot;123&quot;). The variable type
  must be a primitive (boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long,
  short) or a String.</p>

  <h3>Breakpoint Monitors</h3>

  <p>Breakpoints may have one or more monitors assigned to them. A
  monitor is something that is &quot;performed&quot; whenever the
  breakpoint is hit and the breakpoint is not disabled, skipping, or
  expired. Presently only one type of monitor is supported, called a
  &quot;command&quot; monitor. When this monitor is performed, the
  named command is executed, just as if you had entered it yourself.
  For instance, you could add a monitor to invoke the &quot;where&quot;
  command whenever the assigned breakpoint is hit. In addition to the
  built-in commands, any defined alias or macro can be used.</p>

  <h3>Thread Suspend Policy</h3>

  <p>Normally when a breakpoint causes execution of the debuggee VM to
  stop, all of the debuggee threads are suspended. This behavior can be
  modified with the breakpoints properties dialog. The &quot;Suspend
  Threads&quot; radio buttons indicate which threads should be
  suspended when the breakpoint is hit. &quot;None&quot; and
  &quot;All&quot; are obvious, while &quot;Event&quot; may be unclear.
  The event thread is the one in which the breakpoint event
  occurred.</p>

  <h3>Filters</h3>

  <p>Location-based breakpoints (line and method) support thread
  filters. That is, the breakpoint is only considered hit if it occurs
  on a particular thread or threads. The set of threads can be
  manipulated using either the breakpoint properties dialog box, or
  through the <code>filter</code> command.</p>

  <p>Traces and exception catches can have both thread and class
  filters. A class filter causes the trace or catch to only operate
  when the event occurs within the given class or classes. The set of
  class can be manipulated using either the breakpoint properties
  dialog box, or through the <code>filter</code> command.</p>
