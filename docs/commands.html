    <h3>Commands</h3>

    <p>Much of the functionality of JSwat lies in two places: the
    graphical user interface and the command interface. The command
    interface is accessible both in JSwat&#39;s &quot;console&quot;
    mode and in its default graphical mode. In graphical mode, the
    command interface is made up of the &quot;Messages&quot; text area
    and the &quot;Command&quot; text field. Commands are entered in the
    text field and the results are displayed in the messages area.</p>

    <p>To get familiar with the many JSwat commands, I recommend
    running the <code>help</code> command after starting JSwat. This
    will present you with various categories of commands and let you
    browse through the categories. You can learn what commands are used
    for manipulating breakpoints, single-stepping, and many other
    debugging-related operations.</p>

    <h4>History</h4>

    <p>Commands are stored in a &quot;history chain&quot; and can be
    invoked using the <code>!&lt;prefix&gt;</code> and <code>!!</code>
    operators. Earlier commands can be recalled using the up and down
    cursor keys (or Ctrl-p and Ctrl-n keys) to move backward and
    forward through the command history. (Note, this feature is not
    available in console mode.)</p>

    <h4>Aliases</h4>

    <p>Commands can be aliased to other names, offering you the ability
    to make the interface more convenient. Both a command and its
    arguments can be stored as an alias. The alias is invoked by the
    alias name, and may include additional arguments to the original
    command. Use the <code>alias</code> and <code>unalias</code>
    commands to manage aliases.</p>

    <h4>Macros</h4>

    <p>Commands can be grouped into a command macro, to save typing of
    frequently used commands. Invoking the macro will result in
    execution of the commands stored in the macro. Macros can use any
    commands, aliases, or other macros, but cannot use the
    <code>!</code> or <code>!!</code> operators.</p>

    <h4>Startup File</h4>

    <p>JSwat processes what is often called a startup file. That is,
    when JSwat is started, it looks for a file with a particular name
    and processes it. This file may contain JSwat commands to be
    executed when JSwat starts. The file is called
    <code>.jswat/jswatrc</code> and lives in your home directory. JSwat
    also looks for a file named <code>.jswatrc</code> in the current
    directory, and each parent directory until it reaches of the root
    of the file system, processing the files in the order they are
    found.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a startup file.</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
#
# Lines starting with the # character are ignored.
#

# Create some useful command aliases.
alias   go              resume
alias   cont            resume
alias   quit            exit
alias   finish          step out

# Set the path where jswat looks for source files.
sourcepath /usr/java/src
</pre>
    </blockquote>
