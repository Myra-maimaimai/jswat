  <h2>Capturing Debugger Messages</h2>

  <h3>Debugger Messages</h3>

  <p>Debugger messages are those messages seen in the JSwat main window
  whenever a command or action is performed. Each time a breakpoint is
  hit or a single step is performed, a message is printed to the
  window. Normally these messages go to a text area within the JSwat
  window. This text area grows until it reaches the limit set in the
  user preferences. A scroll bar on the side of the text area allows
  you to scroll up to see earlier messages. The text area also has a
  popup menu that allows copying selected text to the system
  clipboard.</p>

  <h3>Capturing Messages</h3>

  <p>JSwat provides a means for capturing the messages. Using the
  &quot;Capture Messages&quot; action found in the &quot;Options&quot;
  menu (as of 12/27/00) you can set the messages to also print to
  JSwat&#39;s standard output stream (the console that started JSwat)
  and/or to a named file. In the dialog that appears after selecting
  &quot;Capture Messages&quot; you may check the &quot;Capture to
  stdout&quot; or &quot;Capture to file&quot; options. If you select
  the &quot;Capture to file&quot;, be sure to enter a filename in the
  text field at the bottom of the dialog.</p>

  <p>To turn off the message capturing, simply bring up the same
  &quot;Capture Messages&quot; dialog and uncheck the checked options.
  If you only wish to change the name of the file which is catching the
  messages, you may simply type a new name into the dialog and press
  okay. The previous file will be closed and the new file will be
  created. Make sure the &quot;Capture to file&quot; option is checked
  before you press Ok.</p>

  <p>Note that when capturing to file the messages do not flush to the
  file immediately. Turning off the file capture will cause the buffers
  to be flushed to disk.</p>
