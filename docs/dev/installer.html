  <h2>JSwat Installer</h2>

  <p>The installer project is found in the <code>installer</code>
  directory in the JSwat source tree. This is a simple Java application
  that extracts the JSwat production build to a location of the
  user&#39;s choosing, and makes some minor changes to the extracted
  files.</p>

  <h3>Testing</h3>

  <p>Testing the installer is simple, just invoke the <em>jar</em>
  target of the <code>installer/build.xml</code> Ant script, then run
  the <code>installer/dist/installer.jar</code> file. This is most
  easily done if you open the installer project in NetBeans. The
  installer has the necessary dummy data to perform a dry-run install,
  which is sufficient for making sure it works.</p>

  <h3>Building</h3>

  <p>Building the installer is achieved by building JSwat for release.
  See the <a href="release.html">release</a> document for
  instructions.</p>
