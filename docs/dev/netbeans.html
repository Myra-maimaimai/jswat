  <h2>The Great Refactoring of 2004/2005</h2>

  <h3>Why The Change?</h3>

  <p>After some time considering the numerous features that I wanted to
  add to JSwat, I came to realize that a system existed already that
  implemented most of the core functionality -- the <a href=
  "http://www.netbeans.org/products/platform/">NetBeans Platform</a>.
  This is not the NetBeans IDE, although the IDE is based on the
  Platform. The NetBeans Platform provides a great many features for
  applications such as JSwat, and it is open source software and free
  to use.</p>

  <p>There are two drawbacks to using this platform however. First the
  console interface adapter will likely not be possible to implement on
  the NetBeans Platform. The second drawback is the jEdit plugin will
  be impossible to implement, or at least it would not make any sense
  since the Platform provides its own very good source editor.</p>

  <h3>What Had To Go</h3>

  <p>Basically all of the interface code. The interface adapters,
  source viewer, and much of the panel code has been replaced.</p>

  <h3>How That Was Done</h3>

  <p>Essentially every class in JSwat was refactored from the ground
  up. Starting with the core functionality, many of the old assumptions
  were now invalid, so much of the code was discarded. Slowly the core
  module was built up with the appropriate functionality and
  behavior.</p>

  <p>The interface code, which consists of the actions and the top
  components, was written from scratch. Bits and pieces of the old code
  were utilized where possible, but for the most part the code is brand
  new.</p>

  <p>Unlike the refactoring of 2001, the work to rewrite JSwat for
  NetBeans took 18 months. This is due almost entirely to the fact that
  I refactored the expression evaluator twice, the breakpoints
  infrastructure three times, and everything else two times or more.
  Using the NetBeans Platform was the best decision I ever made
  regarding JSwat, despite the significant learning curve.</p>

  <h3>How This Has Helped</h3>

  <p>That should be obvious: JSwat has inherited hundreds of features
  from the NetBeans Platform, not the least of which is the fact that
  the code is now based on a very solid platform.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the design and implementation of JSwat has undergone
  a thorough and complete overhaul. More stringent unit tests have been
  developed to ensure that JSwat behaves correctly in each module. This
  has resulted in what is unequivocally the best version of JSwat to
  date.</p>
