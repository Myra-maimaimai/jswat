  <h2>How to Compile, Run, and Debug JSwat</h2>

  <p>The following is an abbreviated set of steps for building JSwat
  from source code. If you encounter complications at any point, please
  refer to the detailed steps given in the following sections.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">JDK 1.6</a> must be
    installed to compile JSwat.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE 5.5</a> must be
    installed, as JSwat is based on the NetBeans Platform, with some
    additional IDE modules.</li>

    <li>Make the build: <kbd>ant build</kbd></li>

    <li>Run the debugger: <kbd>ant run</kbd></li>
  </ol>

  <p>If that worked for you, then you are on your way to developing
  JSwat. However, if there was a problem, continue reading the
  following sections for detailed information.</p>

  <h3>Installing Required Software</h3>

  <h4>Java Development Kit</h4>

  <p>JSwat is written in the Java language, version 1.5. Visit the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">Java SE</a> page and download
  the release appropriate for your system. <em>It is possible, though
  not recommended, to use compatible software from other vendors. In
  this case, make sure that software includes the <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/">Java Platform Debugger
  Architecture</a> (JPDA) library.</em></p>

  <p><em>Presently the IBM JDK 1.5 contains a flawed xalan
  implementation in its boot classpath, so it is not possible to run
  JSwat (and likewise, NetBeans) using this particular JDK. See the
  <a href=
  "http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Netbeans/FaqXalanOnCP">NetBeans User
  FAQ</a> for more information.</em></p>

  <h4>NetBeans IDE</h4>

  <p>JSwat is based on the NetBeans Platform 5.5, and utilizes some of
  the modules provided in the NetBeans IDE. Thus, to build JSwat you
  will need to install the <a href=
  "http://www.netbeans.org/products/ide/">NetBeans IDE</a> version 5.5.
  Developing JSwat within the NetBeans IDE is highly recommended, as it
  makes many of the mundane tasks much easier.</p>

  <p>You may also want to download the NetBeans IDE source code and API
  documentation, which can be found at the URL given above.</p>

  <h3>Building JSwat</h3>

  <p>Once the JDK and NetBeans are installed, you are ready to build
  JSwat. Prior to building JSwat for the first time, it is necessary to
  start the NetBeans IDE and open the JSwat module suite project. This
  will create the necessary build properties files, allowing the
  application to be built from the command-line. Of course, once the
  IDE is started and the projects opened, you may as well build from
  within the IDE.</p>

  <p>To build the application from the command-line, invoke the
  <em>build</em> target on the <code>build.xml</code> in the root of
  the source tree. This will compile all of the modules and produce the
  JSwat modules.</p>
  <pre>
&gt; ant build
</pre>

  <h3>Running JSwat</h3>

  <p>Invoke the <em>run</em> target of the top-level
  <code>build.xml</code> file. You should soon see the JSwat splash
  screen followed by the main window.</p>
  <pre>
&gt; ant run
</pre>

  <h3>Debugging JSwat</h3>

  <p>Invoke the <em>debug</em> target of the top-level
  <code>build.xml</code> file. The application will start in debug mode
  and the IDE debugger will be connected to it automatically. <em>Note
  that this target only works inside the NetBeans IDE.</em></p>
  <pre>
&gt; ant debug
</pre>
