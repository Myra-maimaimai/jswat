  <h2>Setting up the Build Environment</h2>

  <h3>Installing Required Software</h3>

  <h4>Java Development Kit</h4>

  <p>JSwat is written in the Java language, version 6.0. Visit the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">Java SE</a> page and download
  the release appropriate for your system. <em>It is possible, though
  not recommended, to use compatible software from other vendors. In
  this case, make sure that software includes the <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/toolsapis/jpda/">Java
  Platform Debugger Architecture</a> (JPDA) library.</em></p>

  <h4>Apache Ant</h4>

  <p>Building JSwat requires the use of Apache <a href=
  "http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, a build tool written in Java. In
  general you should use the latest stable release, but you may find
  that a slightly older release will work as well. Chances are you will
  have to set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to point
  to the JDK installation, and possibly also <code>ANT_HOME</code>,
  which points to the Ant installation directory.</p>

  <p><em>Alternatively, you can use the <a href=
  "http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a> and rely on its built-in
  Ant, rather than installing a separate version.</em></p>

  <h3>Project Settings</h3>

  <p>In order for the Java projects (core, cmd, and cli) to compile,
  you will need to tell Ant where to find the Java Debug Interface
  (JDI) classes. Normally these are located in a file called
  <code>tools.jar</code> in the JDK <code>lib</code> directory. That
  jar will contain classes in a package called <code>com.sun.jdi</code>
  and those are needed by JSwat. On the Mac, these classes are in the
  main <code>classes.jar</code> archive, so no extra setup is needed,
  just build the projects.</p>

  <p>For all other systems, you will need to set the classpath for the
  three Java projects to include the jar for the JDI classes. See below
  for the details. Note that if your JDK does not have a
  <code>tools.jar</code>, or that archive does not contain the JDI
  classes, then you will need to locate those classes and specify that
  file and path in place of all the references to
  <code>tools.jar</code> below.</p>

  <h4>Core Project</h4>

  <p>Create the file
  <code>core/nbproject/private/private.properties</code> with the
  following contents, creating any missing parent directories:</p>
  <pre>
javac.classpath=\
    lib/org-openide-util.jar:\
    lib/com-bluemarsh-jswat-parser.jar:\
    ${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar
</pre>

  <h4>Commands Project</h4>

  <p>Create the file
  <code>cmd/nbproject/private/private.properties</code> with the
  following contents, creating any missing parent directories:</p>
  <pre>
javac.classpath=\
    ../core/dist/com-bluemarsh-jswat-core.jar:\
    ../core/lib/org-openide-util.jar:\
    ${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar
</pre>

  <h4>Console Project</h4>

  <p>Create the file
  <code>cli/nbproject/private/private.properties</code> with the
  following contents, creating any missing parent directories:</p>
  <pre>
javac.classpath=\
    ../core/dist/com-bluemarsh-jswat-core.jar:\
    ../cmd/dist/com-bluemarsh-jswat-cmd.jar:\
    ../core/lib/org-openide-util.jar:\
    ../core/lib/com-bluemarsh-jswat-parser.jar:\
    ../bcel/release/modules/ext/bcel-5.2.jar:\
    lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar:\
    ${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar
</pre>
