    <h2>
      Console Refactoring
    </h2>
    <p>
      In early 2009 a convincing request to make JSwat suitable as a
      drop-in replacement for jdb was made by Steve Yegge. The goal was
      to exchange jdb for JSwat when debugging Java within emacs. Given
      that after 2005 the entire JSwat code base was now dependent on
      the NetBeans Platform, this was not going to be a quick fix.
      While it is easy to run the NetBeans Platform without any
      graphical interface, it's startup and shutdown time was simply
      much too long. For JSwat to be a suitable jdb replacement, it
      would need to start up and shut down quickly, and NetBeans just
      couldn't do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal goal was to expose the command input and processing
      portion of JSwat, already available in the <code>cmd</code>
      module, as a console-based application. This would entail
      removing anything to do with NetBeans from both the
      <code>core</code> and <code>cmd</code> modules, leaving perhaps
      only a few dependencies on the base libraries within NetBeans.
      These libraries are in fact just plain jar files that can be
      easily used in any Java application. They provide core
      functionality that every piece of JSwat was dependent on.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve the goal of separating the higher level NetBeans
      dependencies from the core JSwat projects, a new service was
      created to interface with the platform. It turned out that only a
      few basic operations were needed, from reading and writing files
      to starting and stopping a progress indicator. The actual
      separation did not take long at all. The trick was in getting the
      newly minted Java projects to be included in the NetBeans version
      of JSwat. Fortunately the NetBeans module system has a simple
      solution in the form of library <a href=
      "http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqWrapperModules">wrapper
      modules</a>. Once such a wrapper was created, the original
      NetBeans based version of JSwat could again be built, this time
      from a set of plain Java projects and a set of NetBeans module
      projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more time consuming effort was filling in the gaps in terms
      of commands that had not been written because they would be
      redundant with the graphical equivalents in the NetBeans based
      version. As a console application, the console version of JSwat
      would need all of the commands necessary for debugging.
      Thankfully most of these already existed in the ancient versions
      of JSwat, last updated in early 2004. For the most part, it was
      simply a process of copying and updating the old code to work in
      the new infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a relatively short time, about a month, JSwat had both a
      console and graphical version once again.
