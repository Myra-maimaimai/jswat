  <h2>How to Write Help Topics</h2>

  <p>The built-in help for JSwat is written using <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javahelp/">JavaHelp</a>,
  which is essentially HTML pages with XML meta-data. The help for
  JSwat currently resides in the <strong>help</strong> module.</p>

  <p>If you are unfamiliar with JavaHelp, be sure to read the
  documentation available at the JavaHelp product page.</p>

  <h3>Mapping Topic Names</h3>

  <p>The first step in creating a new help topic is to define the
  unique name of the topic. For example,
  <code>jswat-attach-debuggee</code> refers specifically to the
  <code>action/attach-debuggee.html</code> help page. This topic name
  is used throughout the JavaHelp meta-data, as well as within the
  JSwat source code. The mapping is defined in the
  <code>jswat-map.xml</code> file.</p>

  <h3>Table of Contents</h3>

  <p>The new help topic must be added to the table of contents file,
  <code>jswat-toc.xml</code>. You may add the same topic multiple
  times, each with a different descriptive text.</p>

  <h3>Help Index</h3>

  <p>Similar to the table of contents is the help index. This is
  defined in the file <code>jswat-idx.xml</code> and is fairly
  self-explanatory.</p>

  <h3>Writing the Topic</h3>

  <p>The help pages themselves are written in HTML. You should be able
  to use any HTML 4 tags, although you should avoid using frames. XHTML
  is also okay, accept that the JavaHelp software does not parse
  terminated empty elements (e.g. <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>), so use the
  HTML format for empty elements (e.g. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>).</p>

  <h3>Referring to the Topic</h3>

  <p>Making references to the help topic is done through the NetBeans
  help APIs. Specifically, when displaying a dialog you can associate a
  help topic with that dialog. Likewise, actions and top components
  also can have help topics. The name used in the code should be
  identical to the name of the help topic in the
  <code>jswat-map.xml</code> file.</p>
