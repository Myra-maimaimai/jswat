  <h2>How to Build as an IDE Plugin</h2>

  <p>JSwat normally builds and runs as a standalone NetBeans Platform
  application. That is, it defines its own menu structure and default
  window arrangement, as well as a splash screen and about dialog.
  However, it is also possible to build and run JSwat as a
  &quot;plugin&quot; for the NetBeans IDE.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Note</strong> that at the moment, it is not possible
  to compile JSwat as a plugin to the NetBeans IDE. It had been working
  when the build process was completely customized. But now that it
  relies on the standard NetBeans module build setup, we can no longer
  build the plugin. At some point, need to devise a build setup for the
  plugin such that it can co-exist with the standalone
  process.</em></p>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>To start with, ensure that your build environment is set up to
  <a href="compile.html">compile</a> JSwat.</p>

  <h3>Preparation</h3>

  <p>Building the plugin form of JSwat is basically a matter of
  modifying a property file. The file is not checked in to revision
  control, so modifying it does not pollute your pending change
  list.</p>

  <h4>build.properties</h4>
  <pre>
building.plugin = yes
test.user.dir = build/ideuserdir
</pre>

  <p>The <code>building.plugin</code> property is the most important,
  obviously, as that controls the building of the plugin module itself.
  It also disables the product module, and the usual product
  branding.</p>

  <p>Setting <code>test.user.dir</code> is optional, but highly
  recommended as it prevents polluting the JSwat test userdir with
  files and settings pertinent only to the IDE binary.</p>

  <h3>Building the Plugin</h3>

  <p>Now that the preparation is complete, simply clean and build the
  entire JSwat module suite, and rebuild the JSwat Plugin module. The
  plugin module is not a part of the module suite because it has
  different module dependencies than the standalone form of JSwat, so
  it is preferable to keep it separated logically.</p>
