  <h2>How to Localize</h2>

  <h3>Localizing to Other Locales</h3>

  <p>Localizing JSwat to other locales should be quite simple. Nearly
  all of the user-readable strings in JSwat are stored in files called
  <code>Bundle.properties</code> in the various directories. These
  files define the strings for the default language, English. Strings
  for other locales must be defined in separate files, using a file
  naming convention as described in the documentation for the
  <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code> class. That information is
  reprinted here for convenience.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Resource bundles belong to families whose members share a common
    base name, but whose names also have additional components that
    identify their locales. For example, the base name of a family of
    resource bundles might be &quot;MyResources&quot;. The family
    should have a default resource bundle which simply has the same
    name as its family - &quot;MyResources&quot; - and will be used as
    the bundle of last resort if a specific locale is not supported.
    The family can then provide as many locale-specific members as
    needed, for example a German one named
    &quot;MyResources_de&quot;.</p>

    <p>Each resource bundle in a family contains the same items, but
    the items have been translated for the locale represented by that
    resource bundle. For example, both &quot;MyResources&quot; and
    &quot;MyResources_de&quot; may have a String that&#39;s used on a
    button for canceling operations. In &quot;MyResources&quot; the
    String may contain &quot;Cancel&quot; and in
    &quot;MyResources_de&quot; it may contain
    &quot;Abbrechen&quot;.</p>

    <p>If there are different resources for different countries, you
    can make specializations: for example,
    &quot;MyResources_de_CH&quot; contains objects for the German
    language (de) in Switzerland (CH). If you want to only modify some
    of the resources in the specialization, you can do so.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The steps for localizing JSwat to another locale should be rather
  straightforward. Start by copying each <code>Bundle.properties</code>
  file to a new name, as described above, and modifying the strings
  after the equals sign (=) on each of the lines in the file.</p>

  <h4>Using NetBeans IDE</h4>

  <p>By far the best way to create and maintain localized resource
  bundles is using the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans
  IDE</a>. This IDE provides a very nice facility for viewing and
  editing resources.</p>

  <p>To use NetBeans to localize JSwat, you must first follow the
  instructions for <a href="compile.html">building</a> JSwat. From the
  IDE, use the <strong>Projects</strong> window to locate the
  <code>Bundle.properties</code> files in each of the source packages.
  Right-click on one of the bundle files and select <em>Add
  Locale...</em> from the popup menu. The dialog that appears provides
  a very convenient means of identifying your language and the
  corresponding locale codes. Select the language, and country code and
  variant if necessary, and click <strong>Ok</strong> to create the new
  resource bundle. This will copy the default bundle to a new file with
  the appropriate name. Once the bundle is created, right-click on the
  bundle file again and select <em>Open</em>, which will open the
  resource bundles in a special editor in the IDE.</p>

  <h4>Testing</h4>

  <p>After you have created new <code>Bundle.properties</code> files,
  you must rebuild JSwat using the instructions provided <a href=
  "compile.html">here</a>. Then launch JSwat on a platform that
  implements the desired locale, which is likely the machine you are
  using to perform the translation. The Java Virtual Machine should
  detect the native locale and display the translated strings.</p>

  <h4>File Format</h4>

  <p>If you are not familiar with Java resource bundles, the file
  format goes something like this:</p>
  <pre>
# A comment line starts with an octothorpe
key1 = value1

key2 = value2 \
on multiple \
lines.

key3 = value3 \n with \t character escapes.

key4 = Today&#39;s date is {0}
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, the strings are referenced by a name (e.g.
  &quot;key1&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;), followed an equals sign (=) and
  the localizable string. The string may contain slash-escapes. When a
  line ends with a slash, it means the next line is also a part of the
  value. Values that contain numbers inside curly braces (e.g. {0}) are
  parameterized. That is, additional text will replace the curly-braced
  number. Generally comments for the resources will describe what those
  values are going to be.</p>
