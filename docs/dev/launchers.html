  <h2>OS-specific Launchers</h2>

  <h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>

  <p>Most of the users of JSwat are running some variant of Microsoft
  Windows, most likely 2000 or XP. The launcher for this platform is
  contained in the <code>launcher/windows</code> directory. This
  includes the C++ source file for the launcher, the makefile to
  compile it, an icon file, a resource descriptor file, and the
  compiled executables.</p>

  <p>If and when it is necessary to recompile the Windows launchers, it
  must be done on a Windows system running <a href=
  "http://sourceware.org/cygwin">Cygwin</a>, the Linux emulator for
  Windows. Not only must the machine have the base Cygwin components,
  it must also have the development tools, which includes
  <code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and MinGW.</p>

  <p>To recompile the Windows launchers, start the Cygwin bash shell,
  change to the <code>launcher/windows</code> directory, and invoke
  <kbd>make</kbd>. This will completely rebuild the launchers from
  source. Test them by copying the <code>.exe</code> files to the
  <code>bin</code> directory under the NetBeans Platform installation,
  and double-clicking one of them in the Windows Explorer. You should
  see the JSwat splash screen appear shortly, followed by the main
  window.</p>

  <p><em>Note that the <code>jswat.exe</code> executable does not
  display a command prompt, while the <code>jswatw.exe</code></em>
  does. This is by design, and useful for debugging.</p>

  <p>The launcher code is simply a modification of the NetBeans
  launcher. The changes include the default clusters list, the branding
  token, and the removal of a class import. In addition, the
  <code>Makefile</code> has the patch from issue 53136 in the NetBeans
  IssueZilla applied to it, with some extra cleanup and the addition of
  the <code>-DWINMAIN</code> definition.</p>

  <h3>Unix-like systems</h3>

  <p>For most, if not all, of the Unix-like systems, the launcher of
  choice is the Bourne shell script named <code>jswat</code> in the
  directory <code>launcher/unix</code>. Modifying this file is trivial
  and no recompilation is necessary. Test this file by copying it to
  the <code>bin</code> directory under the NetBeans Platform
  installation, and then invoking the script. You should see the JSwat
  splash screen appear shortly, followed by the main window.</p>
