JSWAT BUGS
======================================================================


KNOWN PROBLEMS IN JDK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- javac incorrectly includes relative path in SourceFile attribute of
  class files on Windows (see java:build bug #4404985). This causes
  JSwat to not be able to find the source file using the class file.

- Changing the look and feel may cause the command input text field
  to become unusable. This seems to go away in JDK 1.4.

- Watching a static boolean field will crash the HotSpot VM. This is
  reportedly fixed in JDK 1.4 beta 2 (see JDI bug #4440900).

- Calling VirtualMachine.allClasses() can sometimes result in a
  ConcurrentModificationException. (JDI bug #4406439)

- Similar to the above error, you may get NoSuchElementException in
  the classes panel code. Should be fixed in JDK 1.4 beta 2.

- Locals panel code may sometimes report an InconsistentDebugInfoException
  which is caused by the javac compiler (compiler bug #4349534).

- Command field cursor sometimes disappears on Linux. (JFC bug #4309079)

- Dragging mouse out of edit popup and frame causes array out of bounds
  exception. (JFC bug #4246027, so called duplicate of 4352790)

- On Linux/GNOME, java.awt.Frame geometry values incorrectly include
  the window decorations. This does not occur on Win32. This problem
  appears to have been fixed for JDK 1.4.

- Debuggee VM blocks when jswat attempts to send user input through the
  System.in stream on Linux. Use iotest and watch line 14 never return
  from a single step. Use Refresh action to correct the hangup.
  It works fine on Win32, IBM JDK for Linux, and JavaSoft JDK 1.4.
  It also works fine if you type input into the JSwat input text field
  before stepping over line 14. I believe this is a problem with green
  threads.

- Double clicking does not seem to work in IBM JDK 1.3 for Linux. The
  MouseEvent.getClickCount() method always returns '1'.
