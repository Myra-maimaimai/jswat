  <p>Provides the support for the current debugging context (thread and
  stack frame) utilized by many of the graphical views.</p>

  <p>The current context of the debugging session is maintained by an
  implementation of <code>DebuggingContext</code>. The context is set
  and cleared by an instance of <code>Session</code> according to
  events received from the debuggee.</p>

  <p>The <code>DebuggingContext</code> implementations are accessed via
  the <code>ContextProvider</code> static class. To provide custom
  implementations of <code>DebuggingContext</code>, you must install
  your implementation as a &quot;service&quot;. See the NetBeans
  OpenAPIs documentation under &quot;Services &amp; Lookup&quot; to
  learn how this is done.</p>
