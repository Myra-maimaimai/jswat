  <p>Contains the JDI event dispatcher. An instance of
  <code>Dispatcher</code> listens to the JDI event queue and sends the
  incoming events to the listeners that have registered for those
  events. The abstract implementation prioritizes the listeners by
  their class, with breakpoints getting an event before sessions, and
  sessions getting the event before all other classes. Within each
  class of listeners, the ordering is non-deterministic.</p>

  <p>The <code>Dispatcher</code> implementations are accessed via the
  <code>DispatcherProvider</code> static class. To provide custom
  implementations of <code>Dispatcher</code>, you must install your
  implementation as a &quot;service&quot;. See the NetBeans OpenAPIs
  documentation under &quot;Services &amp; Lookup&quot; to learn how
  this is done.</p>
