  <p>Provides one of the most important features of any debugger, the
  breakpoints. Breakpoints are defined by the user and tell the
  debuggee where and when to suspend execution of the debuggee.</p>

  <p>The <code>BreakpointManager</code> implementations are accessed
  via the <code>BreakpointProvider</code> static class. To provide
  custom implementations of <code>BreakpointManager</code>, you must
  install your implementation as a &quot;service&quot;. See the
  NetBeans OpenAPIs documentation under &quot;Services &amp;
  Lookup&quot; to learn how this is done.</p>

  <p>Similarly, instances of <code>BreakpointFactory</code> are
  acquired via the <code>BreakpointProvider</code> static class. To
  provide custom implementations of <code>BreakpointFactory</code>, you
  must install your implementation as a &quot;service&quot;.</p>

  <h2>How Breakpoints Work</h2>

  <h3>Breakpoint Groups</h3>

  <p>Breakpoint groups are collections of breakpoints, as well as other
  breakpoint groups. They can be modified as a whole, which allows
  enabling and disabling an entire set of breakpoints at once.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Disabling a breakpoint group means that the breakpoints in the
    group will effectively be disabled. Their state may be enabled but
    they will remain disabled so long as the parent group is
    disabled.</li>

    <li>A breakpoint group called &quot;Default&quot; is the root of
    the breakpoint group tree. Initially all new breakpoints are placed
    in this group. This group is always enabled when a new session
    starts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Breakpoints</h3>

  <p>Breakpoints are those objects that cause execution to suspend in
  the debuggee. There are various types of breakpoints, from method and
  line breakpoints, to class, variable, and thread breakpoints.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Breakpoints have several states: resolved, disabled, expired,
    and skipping</li>

    <li>Breakpoints support optional conditions. For the breakpoint to
    suspend execution, its conditions must be satisfied.</li>

    <li>Breakpoints keep track of how many times they were hit.</li>

    <li>Breakpoints support optional monitors. A monitor is an action
    that is performed whenever the breakpoint causes execution to
    suspend.</li>

    <li>Breakpoints will suspend execution when they have resolved, are
    not being skipped, have not yet expired, and all of their
    conditions are satisfied.</li>

    <li>When the session disconnects, all of the breakpoints are reset
    such that they are all unresolved and their hit counts are set to
    zero. When this happens their skipping and expired state may
    change.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How a breakpoint is set</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The client will construct a breakpoint using an instance of the
    BreakpointFactory. It provides numerous methods for creating
    breakpoints of different types.</li>

    <li>The client must then invoke the &quot;add&quot; operation on
    the BreakpointManager so that the breakpoint can be maintained by
    the manager from that point onward.</li>

    <li>The BreakpointManager inserts the new breakpoint into the list
    of breakpoints, adding it to the default breakpoint group.</li>

    <li>If the breakpoint needs to be resolved, the BreakpointManager
    will try to resolve it immediately. If that fails, it will try to
    resolve it against each new class that loads during execution of
    the debuggee.</li>

    <li>The BreakpointManager will hook the breakpoint into the system,
    ensuring it is registered with the appropriate services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How breakpoints are resolved</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Each breakpoint implementation listens for the appropriate JDI
    events from the JDI event dispatcher.</li>

    <li>ResolvableBreakpoint is an abstract subclass of
    AbstractBreakpoint, which resolves itself against a
    ReferenceType.</li>

    <li>When a new breakpoint is created, the BreakpointManager will
    ask the breakpoint to resolve itself immediately. If the breakpoint
    is unsuccessful, an appropriate event request is created. The event
    request will contain a property called &quot;breakpoint&quot; that
    refers to the breakpoint that created it. This is used by the
    breakpoint to respond to a particular JDI event, when it
    occurs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What happens when an event occurs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The Dispatcher gets the JDI event and passes it on to the
    interested event listeners.</li>

    <li>Each breakpoint class must listen for the events it is
    interested in.</li>

    <li>The breakpoint receives the event and compares the value of the
    &quot;breakpoint&quot; property of the event request that generated
    this event. If it matches, the breakpoint has been
    &quot;hit&quot;.</li>

    <li>If the breakpoint should suspend execution, the stopped counter
    will be incremented and its monitors will be run.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How breakpoints are persisted</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The breakpoint groups, breakpoints, conditions, and monitors
    are all serialized to a file located in the user directory.</li>

    <li>Serialization begins with the default breakpoint group and
    traverses down the tree until everything has been saved.</li>

    <li>The BreakpointManager handles de/serialization of the
    breakpoints at the appropriate times.</li>
  </ul>
